# Youtube-Video-Classification-on-Twitter
Social media platforms play a significant role in shaping the modern digital information ecosystem by allowing users to contribute to discussions on a wide range of topics. However, the freedom of expression offered by these platforms can potentially threaten the integrity of these information ecosystems when harmful content (e.g., fake news, hateful speech) is shared and propagates across the digital population.
To overcome this problem, mainstream social media platforms (e.g., Facebook and Twitter) deploy diverse moderation interventions to target both inappropriate content and the users responsible for spreading it. However, these moderation efforts are typically enacted in a siloed fashion, largely overlooking other platformsâ€™ interventions on harmful content that has migrated to their spaces. This approach poses risks as any harmful content originating on a source platform can migrate to other target platforms, gaining traction with specific communities and reaching a wider audience. Cooperation among social media platforms is therefore desirable but also practically valuable: knowing what content has been deemed inappropriate on another platform can inform moderation strategies, or help with the early detection of similarly harmful, or
related content.
The general objective of the challenge is to assess the validity of the above mentioned statement. Specifically, we consider YouTube (YT) and Twitter as the source and target platforms. The aim of this challenge is to predict whether a YouTube video shared on Twitter will be removed by YouTube.
