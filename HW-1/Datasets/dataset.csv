Fermented foods (FFs) have the potential to meet these expectations but there is a need to demonstrate their health impacts scientifically, while developing innovative strategies to tackle both sustainability and nutritional health. In this frame, DOMINO will investigate the health impacts of FF-based diet on a healthy population and a cohort suffering from metabolic syndrome to better focus on health biomarkers. We will provide tailor-made microbial solutions using an integrated ‘omics’ strategy and computational biology modelling to address the challenges associated with sustainable food production and healthy nutrition. In six food case studies, selected as representative of the wide diversity of plant-based FF prototypes, we will involve key stakeholders in a multi-actor approach. These objectives will lead to key results: the characterization of the health effect of milk kefir; the application of diagnosis tools based on healthy microbiome/human biomarkers to inform dietary recommendations based on FF for people with metabolic syndrome; the development of an open access database and new computational tools for profiling food microbiomes metabolic interaction during food fermentation and their overlap with the healthy gut microbiome; the delivery of a research and innovation workflow to facilitate the smart design of functional healthy FF, bio-waste valorisation, sustainable processes on plant-based food case studies using the leverage of food microbiomes’ biodiversity; all supported by a federation of key stakeholders and citizens through several living labs and a tailored dissemination strategy. Together we will develop and move towards a vision of the future of FFs in Europe while enhancing the trust of citizens in the food value chain through their involvement and genuine integration of their perspectives, paving the way for citizen-friendly innovation.

In order to train a new generation of Doctoral Candidates to become experts in the design and implementation of transparent, interpretable neural systems and robots, we have built a highly interdisciplinary consortium, containing expert partners with long-standing expertise in cutting-edge artificial intelligence and robotics, including deep neural networks, computer science, mathematics, social robotics, human-robot interaction and psychology. In order to build transparent robotic systems, these new ESR researchers need to learn about the theory and practice of the principles of (1) internal decision understanding and (2) external transparent behaviour. Since the ability to interpret complex robotic systems needs highly interdisciplinary knowledge, we will start, on the decision level, to interpret deep neural learning and analyse what knowledge can be efficiently extracted. At the same time, on the behaviour level, the disciplines of human-robot interaction and psychology will be key in order to understand how to present the extracted knowledge as behaviour in an intuitive and natural way to a human user to integrate the robot into a cooperative human-robot interaction. A scaffolded training curriculum will guarantee that the ESRs have not only a deep understanding of both research areas, but experience optimal skill training to be fully prepared for a successful research career in academia and industry. The importance and need of this research for the industry is clearly visible with the full commitment of 7 leading European and world-wide-operating robotics companies that together cover the majority of Europe’s robot market and a broad spectrum of AI applications.

However, to supply energy in the TWh-range necessary for Net Zero it requires storage at much larger volumes than the currently deployed surface tanks or cavern storage. The next solution for large-scale hydrogen storage are porous saline aquifers and depleted hydrocarbon fields. This perspective is scientifically attractive but remains technically challenging given the lack of active hydrogen storage knowledge and experience. The main target of the SHINE consortium is to explore the feasibility and address technical, geological, and hydrogeological challenges related to hydrogen storage across subsurface porous reservoirs. SHINE will bring together 5 leading universities and research groups, from five European countries, and 5 industrial partners to deliver new training and research skills to 10 young scientists. SHINE aims at providing this next generation of scientists with technical and transferable skills to integrate geosciences, engineering, and microbiology techniques to find solutions to existing open questions in hydrogen storage technologies. Our novel approach is to integrate analytical, monitoring and computing techniques to explore how hydrogen may react with the subsurface minerals, fluids and microbial community potentially affecting the storage operations; model the stress field changes across hydrogen reservoir/caprocks and monitor its geomechanical response during repeated injection/production cycles. The expertly trained cohort of young research scientists resulting from the SHINE consortium will therefore radically improve our understanding of this technology, implement and de-risk its application to potential projects providing the necessary insights into underground hydrogen storage for decision makers in government and industry and contribute actively to the EU transition energy

Yet, the mechanisms of early life immune imprinting have been poorly understood in humans due to the difficulty in obtaining samples and the challenges of deriving the most important data from small sample volumes available. Furthermore, these studies are complicated by the many simultaneous exposures with potential impact on developing immune cells, colonising microbes, and immune-microbe mutualism. To better understand such interactions, a combinations of large population studies with longitudinal data and long-term follow-up and more detailed studies in smaller sets of children will be needed.   Here we propose such a combined and interdisciplinary approach by intersecting multiple cohorts and existing biobanks, applying state-of the art technologies for exposure analyses and immune system investigation. This will enable us to understand the environmental factors shaping human immune systems early in life, their mechanisms of action, and impact on life-course health.  The specific objectives of INITIALISE are: 1.  to elucidate how exposures and genome impact gut microbiome, host immune system and metabolism, and how the interplay of these factors impact life-course health. 2. to define the role of the maturation of the immune system as a mediator between exposures and life-course health. Functional studies will be performed, to test specific mechanisms of environmental factors differing among children with different health outcomes and their imprinting on developing immune cells. 3. to perform a pilot clinical study, targeting the immune system, for personalised disease prevention. 4.  to set up a collaborative data science platform for the studies of early-life factors linked with life-course health.

As such, this Soil Health and Food Mission proposal directly links in to the other HE missions, as well as to the European Green Deal and Farm to Fork strategies. Both public and private sectors are proposing a sustainable vision, that depends on a reliable assessment of the effects of management and policy innovations on soil health. Therefore, there is an urgent need to ensure that the EU sets the benchmark of a reliable cost-effective framework for measuring soil health. In alignment with existing initiatives such as EU Soil Observatory, EJP Soil and the LUCAS Topsoil survey, and using open science approaches, the BENCHMARKS consortium will co-design an Integrated Soil Health Monitoring Framework. This framework will build upon the assessment of soil-based ecosystem functions to co-develop an interactive soil health dashboard for (1) the selection of appropriate soil health indicators, (2) soil health assessment and indexation, and (3) recommendation of management practices to support soil health. The dashboard will be suitable at local, landscape, regional and European scales for a variety of stakeholders in urban, agricultural and forestry land use systems. BENCHMARKS indicators will be relevant to the stakeholder’s objectives, applicable to the different land use systems and pedo-climatic zone and appropriate in terms of logistical, financial and sensitivity requirements. To inform on the appropriate spatial resolution of indicators, the Soil Health Mission and BENCHMARKS proposed indicators (sample-based measurements, stats (data and model derived measurements), space (earth observation techniques)) and citizen science observations will be tested in 24 Living Labs across Europe. Finally, BENCHMARKS will support policy development and value-chain innovation through increased evidence on the links between soil health, functions and ecosystem services.

They also provide a focal point for the much-needed extension of the celebrated Elliott classification program to non-simple C*-algebras.   The main objective of the project is to achieve a critical mass for a successful attack on these problems by combining the weight of strong research groups inside and outside the EU, using graph algebras as a unifying vehicle for hitherto unconnected areas of mathematics. The synergy of these new and innovative connections should allow us to develop and apply brand new methods unavailable otherwise. Furthermore, researchers using graph C*-algebras for applications in adjacent fields are likely to provide groundbreaking insights making impact way beyond graph algebras themselves. In particular, we expect to develop an interdisciplinary dimension involving quantum computing.  We aim to achieve our objective through networking and transfer of knowledge. Between twenty six partners from the EU and North America participating in the network, there are worldwide leading scientific centers. Among about seventy researchers involved in the project, there are famous experts and extremely efficient mentors of young researchers. Combining them with student members of the network yields a top human-resource infrastructure. An important objective is to take advantage of that potential by creating new career opportunities.

ICARIA focuses on both critical assets and infrastructures that were not designed to consider potential climate changes that can increase the unplanned outages and failures, and also on housing, natural and land areas. Cutting edge methods regarding climate scenario building, assets level coupled models and multi-risk assessment approaches will be implemented and replicated in three EU regions to understand how future climates might affect life-cycle costs of these investments in the coming decades and to help risk owners managing public and private infrastructures to assess costs and benefits of various adaptation solutions. Two of the three case studies, Barcelona Metropolitan Area and the archipelago of South Aegean region, are located in the coastal area of the Mediterranean and are facing increasingly extreme weather events (storm surges, pluvial floods, heatwaves, drought and forest fire) with critical socio-economic and environmental impacts. The third region is situated in Austria, representing an area that is highly affected by climate change with effects (glacier melt and heatwaves) that directly impact the prevailing energy production assets (extremely critical infrastructures) and other important sectors. Moreover, other seven follower regions (third parties) will be the first candidates for replication beyond the project.

Major concerns are addressed to the increasing occurrence of these natural events in certain regions of the world, driven by global warming and anthropogenic pressure. Human illnesses related to the intake of contaminated seafood have been attributed to these events. Furthermore, HABs have a significant impact in economic activities such as aquaculture and fisheries. The occurrence of HABs in natural areas utilized for aquaculture (or harvesting/fishing), can affect species growth and nutritional parameters, or even cause mass mortalities, causing huge losses in the industry. The regulation of toxin levels in seafood and other measures (e.g. forced closures to seafood harvest during the occurrence of HABs) have been contributing to protecting humans from serious intoxications. On the other hand, the impacts on the industry lack mitigation measures. This project aims to contribute to the development of solutions for the aquaculture and fisheries sector, through the development of efficient methods for the detection of HABs (early warning), and the development of farming and depuration systems for shellfish to reduce the toxin load. The project also aims to advance in the understanding of regulated and emerging toxins (chemical and toxicological evaluation) and their global expansion, and toxin incidence and persistence in seafood (traditional and non-traditional vectors, species not yet investigated). For the implementation of the project, an interdisciplinary consortium was built, which brings together specialists from different areas of knowledge and who will develop joint research and innovation activities which, collectively, will contribute to the technological innovation of the aquaculture and fisheries and sustainable growth of this sector and to environmental monitoring.

In urbanized areas, aquatic ecosystems constitute ecological corridors between fragmented natural areas supporting a wide biodiversity and variety of ecosystem services, improving the sustainability of cities. Yet, these ecosystems are often degraded by lack of space, cuts of riparian vegetation, artificialization of the channels, impervious areas in the margins, water pollution, noise, excessive lights, among others. This degradation can lead to numerous disservices to human populations, and increase the probability of the emergence of pathogens, lower disease resistance of wildlife and humans, increasing the probability of disease severity and diseases associated with reduced physical activity and permanence in stressful environments found in cities. In view of this, OneAquaHealth aims to demonstrate that the health of freshwater ecosystems and human health and wellbeing in urban contexts are highly interconnected as improving one results in the improvement of the other, reestablishing the balance between nature and humans. To this aim, OneAquaHealth will promote environmental monitoring of early warning indicators that can assess that balance. It will provide decision-makers with a AI-based Environmental Surveillance System able to support adequate and timely decisions and providing effective recovery measures of aquatic ecosystems health (and consequently human health) adequate for different scenarios, including climate changes.

Within the framework of Chrom_Rare, we will focus on a group of clinically well-defined CPs, including Kabuki Syndrome, Charge Syndrome, Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome and Cornelia de Lange Syndrome. Although the causative genes for these CPs have been identified, the consequences of their inactivation both at the molecular and functional level, have not been defined. The clinical features of CPs vary widely, suggesting that the impact of the haploinsufficiency of the affected chromatin regulators could depend on the epigenetic state and/or interactions with additional genetic and environmental factors. Hence understanding the genetic and epigenetic determinants of CPs represent an immediate medical need, as this will ultimately facilitate reaching the development of new therapeutic approaches. Our main goal is to set-up an intra-sectoral, cross-disciplinary training programme that would prepare the next generation of researchers equipped with advanced theoretical, technical and computational skills to study fundamental aspects of chromatin biology and their impact on CPs. In parallel, Chrom_Rare will devise new strategies to translate the molecular findings into new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for patients affected by CPs. To enable understanding the molecular basis of chromatinopathies, we aim at developing multiple disease models recapitulating the main clinical features of CPs (WP1), investigating the genetic, epigenetic and topological determinants of CPs (WP2) and uncovering perturbed regulatory circuitries suitable for therapeutic intervention (WP3). Overall Chrom_rare will address unmet socio-economic, medical and scientific needs, for the understanding and possible treatment for CPs.

Upon autophagy activation cellular components are engulfed by autophagic vesicles, which then fuse with lysosomes for substrate degradation. Despite the unquestionable physiological and medical relevance of nutrient- and pharmacological-induction of autophagy in human health, the precise identity of autophagy substrates and the rules governing their selection in vivo are largely unknown. AUTO-SELECT’s goal is to provide a framework to identify physiologically relevant autophagy substrates in different organs and to determine the signaling events that govern their selection. This proposal relies on (1) newly generated mouse models to genetically manipulate autophagy and key autophagy regulators, (2) tools to quantitatively measure autophagy substrate delivery to lysosomes and subsequent degradation in vivo, and (3) -omic technologies and bioinformatic tools to dissect the molecular events that govern substrate selection in response to diverse stimulations in a tissue-specific manner.  In addition, AUTO-SELECT will develop new strategies to modulate selective autophagy and test their therapeutic relevance in connective tissue disorders characterized by the intracellular accumulation of misfolded procollagen molecules. AUTO-SELECT has the potential to discover new rules governing cargo selectivity during autophagy and, hence, to provide new links between energy metabolism and cellular quality control that might be exploited for autophagy modulation to treat human diseases.

The toolbox framework will have common and specific tools that will be tested, optimised and demonstrated in five different ecosystems, across a latitudinal gradient of the Arctic-Atlantic basin, ranging from the high-Arctic Svalbard (79° N) in the North to the Madeira archipelago (33° N) in the South. The variety of environmental conditions and restoration needs of the five demonstration sites will provide different restoration scenarios with particular specificities in terms of biodiversity, pressures and threats, ecosystems services and stakeholders. The diversity in restoration scenarios will create a unique opportunity to develop a modular toolbox, that integrates common tools with tools that are specific for each restoration scenario into a collective framework. Ecosystem-specific innovations in nature-based solutions for habitat restoration that improve local climate resilience will also be developed, tested, and integrated into a general toolbox framework, establishing guidelines and innovative workflows. The toolbox and tools developed in each demonstration site, for different restoration scenarios, will be made available and tested for replication and upscaling in comparable ecosystems and similar communities, with particular emphasis in promoting stakeholder involvement.

Although a well-populated therapeutic landscape of anti-depressants, the number of patients in remission is particularly low with not more than 6% of the patients who benefit from the current therapeutic journey.  OPADE objective is to identify key biomarkers that support the decision-making process of the healthcare providers. The project focuses on the microbiota – brain -axis which plays a major role in mental health and in particular MDD. Through clinical investigations, the consortium partners will study the combination between genetics, epigenetics, microbiome and inflammatory networks to:  -	Establish patient profiles to predict and optimise the efficacy of the antidepressants prescribed with an increase in the remission rate and reduction of impairment of real-life functioning,  -	Establish the possible correlation between neuroinflammatory indices, target indicators of the microbiome, metabolomics, immune-profile linked, epigenomic, enzymatic algorithms, -	Evaluate molecular and non-molecular biomarkers that may represent predictive indices of recurrence -	Discover new molecular targets for a personalised approach, -	Improve the diagnostic accuracy for primary prevention, -	Evaluate retrospectively, using accurate anamnesis, the onset of depressive symptoms in adolescence. -	Establish how much and to what extent do blood biomarkers correlate with other specific biomarkers 350 patients between 14 and 50 years will be recruited in 6 EU and international countries for 24 months. Real-time EEG and patient cognitive assessment will be collected with blood, stool and saliva samples. Results and analysis will be used to train the AI / ML predictive tool, the main outcome of the project. A patient empowerment tool will be deployed over the project duration.

Therein, the analysis of crop performance with respect to structure, function, quality and interaction with the environment (“phenotyping”) is key for the exploitation of crop genetic diversity required for the enhancement of plant productivity and progress in plant breeding. This requires substantial and concerted action to develop and to increase the availability of phenotyping infrastructures. The European Strategic Forum for Research Infrastructure (ESFRI) has thus identified “Plant Phenotyping” as a priority for the European research area and EMPHASIS has been listed on the ESFRI ROADMAP, addressing primary plant production as the key step in future European agro-food-systems and bio-economy transformation. The Preparatory Phase project (EMPHASIS-PREP, 2017-2021) paved the way towards implementation and subsequent operation. It developed a business plan and established the Interim General Assembly, as main decision-making body, comprising high-level representation from policy and science. EMPHASIS-GO will build on the successful work in the Preparatory Phase, extend the membership with partners from eleven countries fully committed to support EMPHASIS and bring EMPHASIS into operation to fully explore the potential European plant phenotyping by i) developing and deploying services, ii) implement the legal, financial and organisational framework and iii) consolidating the business plan for future operations.

In Europe, Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) is the main governance process to ideally integrate sustainability and exploitation. This requires tools and knowledge to align MSP and marine protected area (MPA) designation processes, which are lacking particularly regarding transboundary coordination and connectivity. Founded on a large amount of expertise and a solid theoretical basis, MarinePlan will co-develop with stakeholders a Decision Support System (DSS) for ecosystem-based maritime spatial planning (EB-MSP) together with best practice guidance to enhance the effectiveness of spatial conservation and restoration measures for marine biodiversity in European Seas. Tools will comprise operational criteria for ecologically or biologically significant marine areas (EBSA), enabling the allocation of conservation and restoration areas at various scales in complex sea areas with multiple uses, while including the effects of climate change. The DSS will be developed and applied at eight European planning sites, from coastal ecosystems to open ocean and the deep sea and from local to trans-boundary scales. Applying and validating the DSS will incorporate realistic planning scenarios, key action points to achieve the EU Biodiversity Strategy, and policy recommendations how to enhance EB-MSP implementation in European Seas. MarinePlan will communicate results to decision-makers at horizontal (between sectors) and vertical (from local to European) levels and enable the transfer of knowledge to areas in differing socio-ecological settings. The improved natural and social science base will ensure effective policymaking to support a greater coherence in implementing environmental policies as well as to enable streamlined planning for marine industries.

The two central ideas we propose are (1) a multi-level, modular and extendable simulation library that combines existing and new models for human driving behavior; in combination with (2) an innovative cross-disciplinary methodology to account for the huge uncertainty in both human behaviors and use case circumstances. This rigorous treatment of the uncertainty is crucial to assess how much of our confidence in model inputs, parameters, and structure is justified. It also makes explicit how experts from different disciplines judge the outcomes and how justified the underlying assumptions really are. Our consortium combines all the expertise needed to develop this methodology (e.g., traffic engineering, human factors, data & computer science). We have the experimental means to gather the evidence beyond the state-of-art needed to realistically simulate (near) accidents in multi-driver scenarios (access to many data sources, advanced driving simulators, and field labs). We have a strong international network to collaborate with and harmonize our approach with academic and professional partners in e.g., the US (NADS facility); Australia (UQ advanced driving simulator and TRACSLab connected driving simulator facilities), China (Tongji Univ. 8-dof driving simulator and large-scale field lab) and Japan (NTSEL). Finally, we have all the relevant partners on-board to test and apply the methodology (Universities and research labs, OEMs and Tier 1, vehicle regulators, type-approval authorities, standardization institutes, insurance companies). i4Driving offers a proposition for the short and the longer term: a set of building blocks that pave the way for a driving license for AVs.

Recombinant adeno-associated vectors (AAV) are the vectors of choice for liver gene transfer and have recently achieved remarkable successes in clinical trials. However, there are still large groups of patients who have limited access to therapy. The major hurdles toward expanding the indication of AAV-mediated liver gene therapy are: i) transient AAV-mediated expression in proliferating hepatocytes, i.e. newborn or regenerating livers, due to dilution of episomal AAV genome in proliferating cells; ii) dose-dependent hepatotoxicity and immune response against AAVs; and iii) pre-existing immunity to AAV capsids, which currently preclude its systemic delivery in about 50% of individuals. AAVolution gathers renowned European experts in the field of AAV vectorology, gene therapy, genome editing and immunology, with the ambitious goal to develop and implement innovative therapeutic tools to effectively address these challenges. To this aim AAVolution proposes: i) to seek novel small Cas nucleases for in vivo AAV-mediated genome editing ii)to develop self-replicating episomal AAVs to avoid transgene dilution in proliferating livers; iii) to generate synthetic AAVs characterized by enhanced potency and reduced toxicity, by screening of novel AAV capsid libraries; iv) and to develop improved technologies to overcome pre-existing immunity to AAVs by transiently reducing the levels of circulating anti-AAV neutralizing antibodies. AAVolution will significantly expand the toolkit for AAV-mediated liver gene therapy, developing novel and improved molecular instruments to address the most relevant hurdles toward safer and more effective therapies, and provide access to treatment to patients that are currently excluded from clinical trials. Moreover, these novel tools will constitute an innovative platform with a potential for broad expansion of disease indications beyond the rare diseases.

In addition, the separation of one product H2 from the other O2 during water splitting is very costly.   The project is designed to address these challenges by i) utilizing the full solar spectrum (300-2500nm) instead of UV-visible light (300-700nm), ii) coupling water splitting with biomass-derivative oxidation to avoid water oxidation, iii) well combining solid Z-scheme UV-visible photocatalysis and Infrared-driven thermal catalysis, and iv) using a flow double tube reactor other than batch reactors, thus  targeting to produce green H2 from both water and biomass with a high quantum yield of 60% . Furthermore the project will co-produce high-value chemicals with a high selectivity of >90%. In addition, the integration of low-cost and efficient catalysts with novel flow reactors will assure a continuous and efficient production of H2 and high-value chemicals. The entire process does not use fossil fuels nor produce CO2, thus a zero carbon-emission technology. Finally the system can be readily scaled up by numbering up the reactor modules. All these are built upon a multidisciplinary and international consortium with the global experts in photocatalysis, thermal catalysis, reactor engineering, product separation, simulation and social science. Therefore the scientific and technical challenges, as well as the environmental, societal and economic impacts will be fully addressed in the project. The proposed technology will typically benefit the EU economy by an innovative green H2 production process from water and biomass, heavily contributing to a low carbon society. In addition, the international team including members from Asia will facilitate the technology exploitation out of the EU, to further benefit the EU economy.

How this massive population of microorganisms, most of which are bacteria, establishes commensal, mutualistic or pathogenic interactions with the human host despite the vigilance of the immune system, is still obscure and requires an in-depth study. The story gets more intricate considering that gut is home for a myriad of Gram-negative bacteria whose outer membrane main constituent is the lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Due to its chemical structure, LPS is considered a potent elicitor of immune inflammatory reactions in mammals, being usually associated to perilous bacteria and detrimental outcomes for human health. Nevertheless, LPS also decorates the membrane of harmless and beneficial Gram-negatives of gut microbiota. How LPS is tolerated and remains (apparently) silent in the gut is a major unsolved question representing a frontier in our understanding of innate immunity.   DEBUGGING-LPS project will contribute to answer this question, starting from the assumption that the chemistry of LPS is the real message taken from human host of the bacterial interaction, either beneficial or harmful. Strategically based on my expertise in organic chemistry, and integrating synthetic chemistry and cellular immunology studies, DEBUGGING-LPS will decrypt the 'chemical language' spoken by LPS in the gut. This project will deliver a clear picture of the chemistry at the basis of the difference between 'good' and 'bad' LPS, providing tools for the exploitation of the acquired knowledge to create novel therapeutics for resolving/mitigating immune disorders. DEBUGGING-LPS has been conceived to go beyond the state-of-the-art, breaking the dogma of LPS as an enemy, leaving space for a new vision of this glycomolecule: i.e. no longer as a toxic bacterial product rather as an immune signal vital for the proper functioning of our body.

Nearly all of these rare diseases are caused by a single inherited mutation and cannot be treated effectively. Repair of the defective gene by gene editing is the only possible curative therapy. However, only for very few rare diseases such gene editing therapy has reached the clinic. The “Gene therapy of Rare Diseases” (GetRadi) consortium aims now to contribute strongly to the establishment of more gene therapies for rare diseases. This will be accomplished by training of future leaders in gene therapy of rare diseases preforming ambitious research projects, with the following objectives: (i) Improving transfer of genome editing tools to target cells, (ii) improving gene editing efficiency, and (iii) improving safety of gene therapy. Strong participation of the pharmaceutical industry to research projects and training, development of novel in vitro and in vivo models for rare diseases to test gene therapies in relevant settings, and application of several unique genome editing tools developed by the applicants to the treatment of rare diseases are hallmarks of the network.  GetRadi brings together strong industrial beneficiaries (AstraZeneca, Miltenyi Biotec) supervising 3 ESR, highly innovative academic beneficiaries supervising 7 ESR, 3 additional industrial partners, and 4 student enrolling universities. Professional outreach training with access to widely used social media channels will be provided by the partner “European Consortium for Communicating Gene and Cell Therapy Information”. Complementary unique expertise that is spread efficiently by network-wide training and secondments, excellent quality of supervision and intersectoral interactions, innovative transferable skill training, and efficient consortium management will result in an exceptional training of future leaders in gene therapy of rare diseases.

GIANT LEAPS delivers the strategic innovations, methodologies, and open-access datasets to speed up this dietary shift, in line with the Farm-to-Fork strategy and contributing to the Green Deal target of reaching climate neutrality by 2050.  Achieving the dietary shift in practice is inherently complex due to the diverse set of actors involved and further hindered by major knowledge gaps, scattered across the various alternative protein sources and the domains of health (safety, allergenicity and digestibility), environment (GHGs and other environmental and climate impacts, biodiversity, circularity), and/or barriers to adoption (technological, sensory, and consumer acceptance). The GIANT LEAPS consortium consists of the key actors and spans all expertise to address relevant knowledge gaps and proactively engages to arrive at optimized future diets based on alternative proteins that are broadly accepted across stakeholder groups. In order to deliver required insights for short-, mid- and long-term decision making and impact, GIANT LEAPS protein sources have been selected for either targeted or full assessment based on their current level of specification. The innovations and improved methods combined with accessible and comprehensive information, generated for a wide collection of alternative proteins, will enable policymakers to prioritise changes in the food system towards the dietary shift based on desired impact, value chain actors to make strategic scientific, business and investment choices, and the general public to make more sustainable and healthy dietary choices.

Solid-state polymer electrolytes and lithium metal anode address these challenges by replacing the flammable and unstable liquid electrolytes and enabling dendrite-free cycling of high-energy lithium metal cells manufactured by sustainable and cost-effective processing. The PSIONIC project advances the development of all-solid-state battery technology by employing amorphous cross-linked Polyethylene oxide (PEO) laminated on the thin lithium foil at the anode and high voltage cathode coated with a single-ion conductive polymer. This will allow to replace the flammable and unstable liquid electrolytes and enabling dendrite-free cycling of high-energy lithium metal cells manufactured by sustainable processing. Special attention will be devoted to the optimization of interfaces between the active material and polymer electrolyte. Materials selection will enable the use of the manufacturing technology available at BlueSolutions, which is readily scalable, based on sustainable processing using solvent-free extrusion. PSIONIC is aiming to develop cells with a safety hazard level 2, since no liquid component will be in the cell at the end of the project.  The research and innovation actions carried under the PSIONIC project will not only just contribute to the technological advancements of all-solid-state Li-ion batteries in terms of safety, reliability, performance, cost, and sustainability, but will also enable higher uptake by the electromobility sector and end consumers, paving a pathway towards climate neutrality, and green energy transition.

Although several technologies have been developed to facilitate the processing of data while preserving privacy, they have not made significant inroads into real use cases, due to several reasons. ENCRYPT will develop a scalable, practical, adaptable privacy-preserving framework, allowing researchers and developers to process data stored in federated cross-border data spaces in a GDPR-compliant way. Within this framework, a recommendation engine for citizens and end-users will be developed, providing them with personalised suggestions on privacy preserving technologies depending on the sensitivity of data and the accepted trade-off between the degree of security and the overall system performance. The ENCRYPT framework will be designed taking into consideration the needs and preferences of relevant actors, and will be validated in a comprehensive, 3-phase validation campaign, comprising i) in-lab validation tests, ii) use cases provided by consortium partners in three sectors, namely the health sector, the cybersecurity sector, and the finance sector, that include cross-border processing of data, and iii) external use cases including privacy preserving computations on federated medical datasets. ENCRYPT will be realised by a multidisciplinary consortium of 14 partners, comprising six companies (including three SMEs, one start-up, and two enterprises), and eight research institutes/universities, and covering the value chain for privacy-preserving computation technologies.

In order to keep the disease in a “quiescent” status and to prevent relapses, a significative percentage of patients will remain on long-term drug therapy: not only this has an impact on both healthcare system resources and patients’ quality of life, but there are even concerns regarding the side effects of long-term immunosuppressant therapy.Over the past 20 years, a considerable amount of evidence was produced to support the immunomodulatory role of the appendix in the development and course of UC: one of the proposed theories is that the appendix could act as a reservoir for commensal bacteria that can be secreted into the colon, affecting its microbiome and immunological response; another theory describes the appendix as the ""priming site” for the cytokine production and the immunological cascade that may trigger inflammation in colon and rectum. In 2019, Stellingwerf et al. demonstrated the efficacy of appendectomy in the treatment of refractory UC, and in the same year the PASSION study demonstrated the presence of clinical response in 50% and endoscopic response in about 30% of patients refractory to biologic therapy and subjected to appendectomy instead of colectomy, and correlating the histological response on colic biopsies to the inflammatory status of the appendix. The idea of our study moves from these assumptions: we aim to evaluate the impact of appendectomy in patients with UC who are candidates to the treatment with biologics, because of conventional therapies failure. To further reduce any ethical problems and significantly lower any surgical morbidity, we will restrict the population of our study to only patients with active left-sided colitis, so that the surgery for appendectomy will take place on a non-inflamed cecum. Primary endpoints are steroid free clinical remission, endoscopic remission, and assessment of quality of life at 3 and 12 months.Secondary endpoints include the assessment of a clinical response, the assessment of complications for both treatments, the evaluation of histological remission, the immunohistochemical evaluation of the IgA / IgG ratio and correlation between the findings on the appendix and those on colonic biopsy at 3 and 12 months, and the evaluation of failure rate at 3, 12 and 24 months, Our aim is to demonstrate that appendectomy, a relatively simple surgical procedure that can also be performed in day-hospital with a very low expected complication rate, might be superior (or not inferior) to biological therapy, avoiding patients starting a chronic, long-lasting therapy, with the consequent risk of immunosuppression and adverse events, and with possible higher costs for the health system in the long term."

Thus, there is an urgent need for an integrated approach for an enhanced understanding of the interaction, complementarity and trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation measures, especially regarding the expected increase in region-al mean temperature, precipitation and changing soil moisture (IPCC AR6 WG I). Furthermore, this under-standing and knowledge needs to be provided to a broad audience to support local authorities in EU partner countries in developing regional programmes.  KNOWING aims to develop a modelling framework to help understand and quantify the interactions between impacts and risks of climate change, mitigation pathways and adaptation strategies. The framework will be used to assess thAdvancing climate science and further broadening and deepening the knowledge base is essential to inform the societal transition towards a climate neutral and climate resilient society by 2050, as well as towards a more ambitious greenhouse gas reduction target by 2030. There is a need for research that furthers our understanding of past, present and expected future changes in climate and its implications on ecosystems and society, closing knowledge gaps, and develops the tools that support policy coherence and the implementation of effective mitigation and adaptation solutions. Currently, there is a lack of knowledge of the Earth system and the ability to predict and project its changes under different natural and socio-economic drivers, especially regarding complex interrelations, rebound effects and behavioural aspects. Therefore, a holistic, system-aware and behaviour centred approach is needed to identify and implement realistic and effective climate mitigation pathways.

We are still in urgent need of finding therapeutic strategies able to efficiently block the progressive immune-mediated loss of pancreatic mass and significantly slow the rate of T1D disease progression. One therapeutic strategy, based on the purification of a blood circulating subpopulation of lymphocytes (the regulatory T, or Treg cells, playing a key role of inflammatory response suppression) from a patient, their expansion in vitro, and transfer back to the patient demonstrated a sensible efficacy. However, these “living drugs” are potentially prone to lose their protective function and actually become pathogenic in vivo. The use of very small and biologically stable extracellular vesicles (EVs), released by Treg cells and shown to exert an immune suppressive action over pro-inflammatory cells may represent a valuable alternative to cell-based therapies, but nobody has ever tested their potential as innovative therapeutics to slower pancreatic damage and disease progression in T1D children. In the present project, we propose to test EVs released by human Treg cells (Treg-EVs) for their capability to block the activity of pro-inflammatory T cells in a composite in vitro and in vivo approach. In particular, we will test the capability of Treg-EVs to block the disease itself, in a mouse model of T1D, by following glucose control, pancreatic damage and finally disease progression upon infusion of Treg-EVs in diabetic mice. In addition, the thorough molecular characterization of human Treg-EVs in both health and T1D may help to identify the potential crucial determinants of the immune suppressive function associated with Treg-EVs. The knowledge acquired through the development of the proposed project will tell us whether Treg cell-derived EVs have a potential to be used as therapeutic agents in T1D also through an autologous approach and whether their efficacy may be increased by augmenting the quantity of specific EV-associated molecules directly involved in EV anti-inflammatory action.

The occurrence of these structures in functional regions of the human genome, namely oncogene promoters and telomeres, highlights the breadth of biological functions that they regulate.  According to many studies, targeting G4 and iM secondary structures has proven to be a realistic pharmacological strategy that can lead to antitumor effects. On this path, several G4 ligands are undergoing clinical trials. However, the peculiar chemical requisites allowing G4/iM binders to exert their best anticancer activity have not been defined yet and there is still a strong need for a deeper understanding of their mechanism of action in the cellular context.  The main goal of this project, which takes inspiration from the one submitted to AIRC by Prof. Antonio Randazzo (IG 2021 #26313), is to provide a more in-depth knowledge of how G4/iM binders act in the cellular environment. In particular, this investigation aims at dissecting the transcriptional response of cancer and normal cells to the treatment with such molecules and, at the same time, at defining an unprecedented and reliable structure-activity relationship for these ligands, laying the foundations for the design of new anticancer agents.  In order to address the aforementioned aims, the work will be organized into five sections: Section 1 will be focused on the in vitro selection of ligands able to selectively bind to G4 and iM structures; in Section 2, the cell lines to be used will be chosen and treatment time and doses will be optimized; Section 3 will be dedicated to identify, among the selected ligands, the ones able to actually alter G4/iM levels in cellulo; in Section 4, the transcriptional studies will be carried out and, finally, in Section 5, data will be analyzed and interpreted. The completion of the research plan will result in a detailed picture of how the transcriptional landscapes of cancer and normal cells are perturbed by G4/iM ligands. This will allow to determine which oncogenes can really be targeted by those compounds, suggesting the type of cancer they could treat. Also, by integrating the transcriptional signatures dictated by the treatment with the anti-proliferative activity of the compounds, it will be possible to reveal potential correlations between the expression of certain genes and the toxicity of the G4/iM binders, clarifying their biological mode of action. This project will directly impact the cancer community, providing fresh knowledge about the biology governing the cellular response to G4/iM binders and making space for the rational design of new anticancer tools. In other words, this investigation will help to depict transcriptome landscapes that make cancer cells sensitive to the treatment with G4/iM ligands, thus paving the way towards the development of a new generation of more effective antitumor agents.
100|grant.13060079|25945; 16358|Targeting neutrophil extracellular traps to prevent metastatic progression|Targeting neutrophil extracellular traps to prevent metastatic progression|Metastasis is the main cause of cancer-related death since current treatment regimens usually fail to provide durable responses in metastatic patients. Previous studies suggested that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) released by activated neutrophils can modulate different steps of metastatic cascade. In addition to their function as a host defense mechanism, NETs were reported to promote metastatic dissemination of cancer cells by entrapment of circulating tumor cells and by driving adhesion, proliferation, migration and invasion through not completely elucidated signaling pathways. Major components of NETs are double stranded DNA, histones and granular proteins such as myeloperoxidase (MPO) and neutrophil elastase (NE). Degradation of DNA inhibits cell adhesion to NETs and reduces the NET-driven development of metastatic sites in liver and lungs of animal models. More recently NET-DNA was reported to interact with a DNA receptor, termed coiled-coil domain containing protein 25 (CCDC25), expressed on the plasma membrane of cancer cells.  On the other hand, we have previously shown that α5β1 and ανβ3 integrins mediate cancer cell adhesion to NETs by binding to their common substrate fibronectin, which was found to localize inside the web-like structure of NETs. Our working hypothesis is that NETs with their ability to interact with both β1/β3 integrins and DNA receptors on the surface of cancer cells can trigger signals through two different receptors that converge on common pathways modulating adhesion, motility, invasion and proliferation.  The main goal of the present project is to test in vitro and to monitor in vivo the effects of different strategies targeting NETs, namely  1) co-targeting of β1/β3 integrins and DNA receptors; 2) inhibition of the shared downstream signaling pathways; 3) preventing NETs formation; 4) disruption and degradation of NETs. The expression CCDC25, β1/β3 integrins and downstream mediators will be tested in a panel of cultured tumor cell lines. Then NET-dependent cell adhesion, migration and invasion will be evaluated in the presence and absence of antibodies recognizing β1/β3 integrins, CCDC25, ILK inhibitors, RAC1-CDC42 inhibitors, DNase1 and proteinase K alone or in combination. Silencing of β1/β3 chains or CCDC25 will be performed to test the effects on NET-driven cell adhesion, migration and invasion in the presence or absence of agents targeting the companion receptor. PAD4 inhibitors and NE inhibitors will be tested for their ability to inhibit NET release from neutrophils in co-culture with cancer cells. Finally, we will test the ability of selected compounds to inhibit NET-driven metastatic dissemination in liver and lungs of animal models. We expect to identify the best agents and combination of agents capable of inhibiting NET-dependent adhesion, migration and invasion of cultured tumor cell lines. Furthermore, we expect to identify the best treatment strategy capable of preventing the NET-driven metastatic dissemination of cancer cells in animal models.  Despite the deep knowledge of the metastatic process and many systemic treatment regimens, the cure rates of metastatic patients remains disappointingly low. The identification of a novel therapeutic strategy preventing metastatic dissemination of cancer cells would provide a considerable clinical benefit for cancer patients.

Previous work suggests dysregulation of cell's transcriptomic state, imposed from the core regulatory circuitries (CRCs), as one of NB trigger events. Noncoding somatic mutations may be among the genetic alterations that affect CRCs. However, their potential impact on oncogenic CRCs remains unexplored in NB. Our hypothesis is that noncoding somatic mutations, by causing the dysregulation of the normal transcriptional program, can drive NB tumorigenesis. The objective is to explore the role of noncoding somatic mutations in altering NB CRCs and functionally characterize their action mechanisms.  1. We will identify noncoding somatic SNVs/INDELs by analysis of 336 tumor-normal pairs analyzed by whole genome sequencing (WGS). We will also use RNAseq data from 249 tumors matched with WGS data. 2. By ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq, we will map the open chromatin regions (OCRs) and the binding sites of master transcription factors (TFs) forming CRCs of NB (ADRN-TFs: PHOX2B, GATA3, HAND2, TBX2, MYCN, LMO1, ISL1, ASCL1, and MES-TFs: FOSL1, FOSL2, JUN, PRRX1 and NOTCH3) in ADRN (SHSY5Y/SKNBE2C) and MES (SHEP2/GIMEN) cell lines. 3. We will then perform an enrichment analysis of noncoding mutations in ADRN and MES binding sites that reside in OCRs to demonstrate an accumulation of mutations in these regulatory elements defined as set of active transcription factor binding sites (saTFBS). 4. We will map ADRN-TFs or MES-TFs binding events, with enrichment of somatic mutations in ADRN and MES cells, in sympathetic neuron-like cells (SNC) and neural crest cells (NCC) to distinguish ADRN-specific, MES-specific, SNC-specific and NCC-specific mutated saTFBS. 5. To search for the target genes of the mutated saTFBS, we will perform HiC, CRISPR-Cas9 and then will compare the expression of identified target genes between mutated and wild-type tumors. 6. To functionally validate the noncoding regulatory mutations we will use luciferase, ChIP-pcr and EMSA assays. To demonstrate that the mutated saTFBS of CRC TFs affect the cell's transcriptional program, we will compare the transcriptomic profile of ADRN and MES NB isogenic cell lines with wild-type and mutated saTFBS. 7. To demonstrate that noncoding mutations can promote initiation and progression of NB, we will monitor and compare the isogenic wild-type and mutated NB cell lines for phenotypic effects. 1) the discovery of the noncoding somatic mutations that drive tumorigenesis in NB by perturbation of the cell transcriptional program determined by master TFs in CRCs; 2) the determination of mechanisms by which noncoding somatic mutations act as oncogenic drivers.  The successful completion of this project is expected to have a sustained and lasting impact on the field by uncovering novel genetic alterations that will serve as biomarkers for outcome as well as targets for new therapies. This will ultimately lead to the realization of precision medicine for NB and demonstration of the clinical relevance of genomic discoveries in cancer.

However, DNA is structurally very dynamic and able to adopt a number of alternative secondary structures, such as G-quadruplexes (G4) and i-motifs (iM). G4s and iMs have attracted a lot of attention since they have been found in regulating regions of the genome such as oncogene promoters and telomeres, where they exert a biological role. Many studies have demonstrated that targeting G4 and iM structures is a realistic and attainable pharmacological strategy that promises to lead to significant therapeutic advantage in the treatment of cancer. However, in order to turn G4 and iM ligands into effective anti-cancer drugs, it is necessary to have a more in-depth knowledge of their mode of action, overcoming a number of limitations of the investigations carried out so far. The main aim of the research project is to provide a deeper understanding of the mechanism of action of G4 and iM-interacting agents. In particular, the project aims to understand the degree of target gene selectivity of the G4/iM ligands and, at the same time, to determine possible off-target effects due to the activation of different and unpredicted cellular pathways. These results will suggest the structural requisites necessary to exert the best biological activity and will allow to define an unprecedented and reliable structure-activity relationship for these ligands, which will pave the way to the design of a new generation of G4/iM ligands with improved anti-cancer activity. The experimental design is divided in seven tasks. Task 1 is dedicated to the choice of ligands selective for G4 and iM structures. Task 2 is focused on the selection of cell lines and optimization of times and doses of the treatments. Task 3 is dedicated to the preparation of the samples for the transcriptomic (Task 4), proteomic (Task 5) and metabolomic (Task 6) analyses. Finally, the outcome of the omics studies will be merged in a data integration step, where a complete biochemical interpretation of the results will be performed (Task 7). By integrating the multi-omics data, we expect to have an almost complete picture of the target gene selectivity of G4 and iM ligands and possible off-target effects. The results will allow to determine the chemical features that make the ligand more effective on cancer cells and safer on somatic ones. Then we will determine if it is more convenient to target G4 or iM, or even both structures.  This research project will suggest which oncogene promoter can be really druggable, so to address each molecule to the treatment of a specific tumor. We expect also to obtain also information about the cellular reprogramming induced by the treatments and therefore propose potential co-treatment with other drugs, paving the way to personalized therapies based on tumor characteristics for an improved precision oncology.
100|grant.13058826|26002; 16269|The role of gasotransmitters in regulating ILC functions in cancer|The role of gasotransmitters in regulating ILC functions in cancer|Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for more than 8 million deaths per year. Cancer immunotherapy represents today the most promising anti-cancer strategy since the development of the first chemotherapies. However, primary or secondary resistance to therapy represents the major drawback in a large number of patients. Recent findings suggest that understanding the tumor microenvironment (TME) will be key to optimize immunotherapies. In that context, cytokine secreting cells are central players in modulating positive and negative signals in the TME. A recently described family of rare, but potent cytokine secreting cells, called Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILCs), is emerging as key regulator of immunity. ILCs mediate tumor immune responses by displaying both pro and anti-tumor effects according to the tumor type. Nevertheless, little is known on the key mediators that influence their pro- or anti-tumorigenic behavior. Among the different component of the TME, gasotransmitters (nitric oxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide) and their synthesizing enzymes, are emerging as key modulator of tumor immune responses and these pathways where shown to affect cancer progression.  ILCs are primarily tissue-resident cells, that respond swiftly and potently to innate stimuli. In this context, ILC function is regulated by the different components of the TME. Likewise, gasotransmitters are emerging as key TME components affecting cancer progression. Thus, our hypothesis is that by dissecting and manipulating gasotransmitter pathways in ILCs we could switch TME-immunosuppression and promote anti-tumor immunity, favoring cancer elimination. The aim of this project is to decipher the role of gasotransmitters in ILC biology in tumor immunity, to identify potential new therapeutic targets for cancer patients. In detail, we will: 1)	Dissect at the single cell level the gasotransmitter pathways in ILCs in healthy donors and cancer patients.  2)	Functionally characterize the gasotransmitter pathways in vitro and in vivo in ILCs, gaining valuable insight into the regulation of ILC by these gas mediators in cancer.  3)	Target gasotransmitter pathways in ILCs in relevant tumor mouse models to unravel potential therapeutic applications in patients  Both human and murine studies will be employed to define the role of these new metabolic pathways in modulating ILCs activity/plasticity in cancer settings.  This project could unveil the first evidence that gasotransmitter pathways have a critical role in ILCs, contributing to tumor immunity. We expect gasotransmitter enzymes to influence ILC-mediated tumor immunity by modulating their effector functions and/or plasticity. Moreover, by the direct validation of our observations in relevant in vivo tumor models we expect to define the ILC-gasotransmitter axis as an attractive and innovative therapeutic target for cancer. Search for therapeutic options to target innate immunity, e.g. ILCs and natural killer cells, in cancer patients is a highly active research field. Our project perfectly fits in this niche and is expected to provide insight on a novel druggable pathway, the one of gas mediators, in ILCs in patients. This strategy might prove synergistic with other therapeutic options and help to overcome resistance to immunotherapies.

D2-produced T3 can play a critical role in the physiology of malignant cells in vivo. In fact, the functional role of TH in the landscape of tumorigenesis is likely to have broad implications in terms of counteracting the multiple steps of cancer formation and progression. However, although the effects of D2 in cancer are beginning to be elucidated, the up-stream regulators of D2 in cancer are still poorly understood. Based on preliminary data linking the expression of D2 to the oncosuppressor Trp53 gene, this proposal will evaluate novel aspects of the intracellular adaptation of TH signaling with the p53 pathway, whose actions represent an unavoidable step in the keratinocyte carcinomas (KCs). Moreover, we will assess the potential of D2 inhibition as therapeutic tool for the cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (cSCC). In the SA1 we will dissect the crosstalk between p53 and D2 in skin tumorigenesis in vivo. In the SA2 we will assess the intriguing possible involvement of D2 and D2-produced TH in DNA damage repair mechanisms in epithelial tumorigenesis. In SA3 we will test candidate TH antagonists to assess the effects of anti-tumoral potential in SCC. The characterization of the functional consequence of the interplay p53-D2 signaling in the skin tumorigenesis (SA1) will be assessed by in vivo studies in skin-specific D2KO mouse model, expressing constitutive or conditional mutant Trp53 gene and subjected to chemical cancerogenesis for SCC formation. The evidence that p53-dependent D2 inhibition is a key event in the regulation of DNA damage response genes in SCC tumorigenesis (SA2) will be assessed by performing RNAseq on epithelial compartments of solid tumors arised in the p53KO/D2KO versus p53KO/D2WT mice. Furthermore, the possibility of using pharmaceutical compounds to selectively modify D2 activity as a novel biomedical tool for cell-based therapies in skin tumors (SA3) will be carried out by in vitro characterization of the effects of rT3 as anti-tumoral agent in mouse SCC. We expect to shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between p53 and D2 that in turn could converge on the regulation of new T3-dependent genes involved in skin tumorigenesis program and that identify druggable D2-inhibitor compounds could offer the possibility to develop pharmacological strategies to treat cancer and other TH-dependent diseases. Due to its high risk of metastasis, cSCC is considered the main cause of death in keratinocyte carcinomas. Whereas cancer survival rate has been improved over the years, due to early diagnosis and cancer growth inhibition, limited progress has been made in the treatment or in slowing KCs cancer metastasis. The molecular pathways involved in the metastatic process and the biochemical events underlying the crosstalk between tumor cells and their microenvironment may represent potential targets for metastasis prevention and inhibition.

Novel next-generation selective RET inhibitors (BLU-667, LOXO-292) showed promising anti-tumor activity in clinical trials so that FDA granted accelerated approval to both. Nevertheless, the acquisition of drug resistance is expected.  Our preliminary data suggested the involvement of EGFR signaling in sustaining resistance to RET inhibitors. Interestingly, EGFR down modulation by genetic manipulation and pharmacological inhibition reverts the resistant phenotype in vitro. On the contrary, EGFR over-expression reduces the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to RET specific inhibitors. Thus, we hypothesize that targeting EGFR signaling pathway in combination with RET inhibitors therapy may provide a novel treatment strategy for patients with NSCLC.  Our aims are: 1) To investigate gene expression patterns underpinning mechanisms of resistance to BLU-667 and LOXO-292; 2) To explore alternative treatments that can circumvent resistance to BLU-667 and LOXO-292 using in vivo models; 3) To extend and validate therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance to RET inhibitors using ex vivo tumor organoids and PDX. To achieve our goals, we will first treat mice engrafted with Lc-2/AD parental cells and Lc-2/AD EGFR over-expressing cells with either vehicle, BLU-666 and LOXO-292, to verify whether EGFR over-expression impairs tumor sensitivity to both drugs. Then, we will inoculate our generated cells resistant to RET inhibitors in Balb/c mice to assess the efficacy of anti-EGFR and anti-RET drug combinations in vivo to circumvent resistance to specific anti-RET. Moreover, in accordance with our preliminary data showing higher migratory and invasive capabilities of resistant cells, we will verify the efficacy of the novel drug combination also in the prevention of tumor metastasization. Finally, we will use three-dimensional organoids cultures and Patients Derived Xenograft (PDX) as a platform for a validation testing of therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance to RET inhibitors. We expect to provide new mechanistic insights regarding signaling pathways that induce resistance to novel specific RET inhibitors, BLU-667 and LOXO-292. We expect to in vivo validate EGFR signaling as a key targetable pathway, which can restore sensitivity to specific anti-RET. We expect to model clinical resistance and to overcome it by using PDX and organoids derived from patients' biopsies. Thus, this analysis might explore signaling patterns crucial in the acquisition of resistance phenotype to BLU-667 and LOXO-292 and allow to discover novel therapeutic targets to circumvent and prevent resistance. The results of this research proposal will provide critical information and strong implications for the treatment of RET-rearranged NSCLC patients. Despite the positive clinical outcomes, not all patients benefit from RET inhibition and a significant fraction eventually progress, underscoring the need to discover novel therapeutic combinations that circumvent resistance to specific anti-RET. Clarifying molecular mechanisms sustaining NSCLC growth and resistance to RET inhibitors, we will be able to propose novel therapeutic strategies to be transferred to patients unresponsive to RET inhibitors.

Aiming at overcoming these drawbacks, a still open challenge is the identification of effective molecular targets common to all cancer types. In this frame, G-quadruplexes - i.e. non-canonical nucleic acid structures located at telomeres and oncogene promoters - emerged as appealing targets for general, selective treatment of cancer, due to their key role in regulation of typical mechanisms common to all cancer types. We recently identified a new hit compound, based on a water-soluble naphthalene diimide (hereafter named NDI) as G-quadruplex selective ligand exhibiting potent anticancer activity in vitro (low nanomolar range IC50). Simultaneously and selectively targeting telomeric and oncogenic G-quadruplexes by small organic molecules could produce a synergistic activity against cancer cells, without side effects on healthy cells. As a main requirement to evolve candidate drugs featured by low-to-null toxicity, a G-quadruplex ligand has to specifically recognize genomic G-quadruplexes, discriminating duplex DNA. Considering the promising results obtained for the above-mentioned NDI, we expect to improve its selectivity of action towards multiple G-quadruplexes and cancer cells by rational design of a focused library of its analogues. The rational design and synthesis of first-generation analogues of the above-mentioned NDI as G-quadruplex ligands will be performed, aiming at discovering lead anticancer candidate drugs ready for in vivo studies. By combining biophysical and in vitro analysis, we will get a deeper insight into the structural elements crucial for G-quadruplex vs. duplex selective recognition. This systematic study will allow correlating the G-quadruplex ligand chemical structure with their in vitro activity. Rational design and synthesis of a focused library of NDI analogues will be performed with the aid of NMR-based models of NDI/G-quadruplex complexes. Then, the evaluation of affinity and selectivity of the NDI analogues towards biologically relevant G-quadruplexes will be carried out by the G4-CPG assay, an affinity chromatography-based method we recently developed to rapidly and efficiently identify high-affinity G-quadruplex ligands, able to selectively recognize G-quadruplex over duplex structures. The strongest, most selective ligands will be then tested for their effective anticancer activity by biological assays on different cancer cell lines and healthy control cells, and genomic G-quadruplex targeting will be evaluated by specific assays. Finally, an in-depth biophysical study of the interaction with G-quadruplex models will be performed for the most active and less toxic analogues. We expect to validate our newly designed NDI-based molecules as strong G-quadruplex ligands, able to target multiple DNA G-quadruplexes - involved in molecular mechanisms typical of cancer cells - discriminating duplex DNA. In a hit-to-lead selection process, we expect the best ligands to exert marked anticancer activity on different cancer cells and low toxicity on normal cells, so to rapidly progress to in vivo studies. The discovery of a universal therapy based on a multi-target approach, causing limited-to-null toxicity, would allow caring all cancer patients regardless of the tumor types they are affected, developing a simple, but effective and low cost anticancer medical treatment for routine clinical practice.
100|grant.13046007|505676591|Generalised Maxwell theories - theoretical structure and experimental tests|Generalised Maxwell theories - theoretical structure and experimental tests|The electromagnetic field is one of the most important system in physics. All the information we are receiving and all measurements we are doing rely on electrodynamics. Though the Maxwell equations provide an extremely successful description of all electromagnetic phenomena there are reasons to reconsider this theory: (i) The standard formulation of electrodynamics leads to severe problems in the self-force problem (radiation reaction) of charged point particles. One derives unphysical pre-acceleration as well as run-away solutions. (ii) In constructive axiomatic approaches to establish the space-time geometry of General (and Special) Relativity the unique properties of light play an essential role. Any modification of the phenomena of electrodynamics will also be directly related to a modified space-time geometry. This is also related to (iii) the search for a theory of Quantum Gravity. Since according to our present understanding General Relativity and Quantum Theory are theoretically not compatible, a new theory combining the geometric and quantum aspects of our world has to be different from at least one of these theories what, for consistency, also would change the Maxwell equations. Accordingly, it is of utmost importance to find out whether the equations underlying all electromagnetic phenomena are the well-known Maxwell equations or whether one has to take into account modifications.Accordingly, we have to discuss all possible modifications in a structured way and then to explore the experimental significance of these modifications. Thereby we will proceed in a systematic way in that we discuss non-linear, non-local and non-homogeneous extensions of the Maxwell equations. For these modifications we discuss wave propagation, stationary solutions for point sources, the equation of motion for charged particles including self-force, the hydrogen atom, and the Equivalence Principle for electromagnetically bound systems. Whereas the planned investigation is theoretical, it will also be of high relevance in view of experiments: It will provide additional or new interpretations of experiments that have already been done, and it will also suggest new experiments dedicated to particular aspects of the Maxwell equations. If it turns out that there might be modifications of these equations all measurements and observations have to be re-interpreted.Orléans and Bremen are amongst the most active groups worldwide in this research area. This project will benefit from a mixture of common and complementary expertise. Both groups are connected to top-level international collaborations. The coordinators, additional applicants together with further co-workers will be a strong collaborating team in order to work on the proposed work plan.

They find numerous applications in quantum simulations and quantum computing that range from adiabatic pulse sequences generating quantum gates in superconducting platforms to the preparation of many-body states in cold atoms, to name just a few. While the adiabatic theorem enables a variety of applications, it is also a source of fundamental limitations both in required timescales and restricting to ground/eigenstate conserving operations. This fundamental science project explores a novel concept as a seed for future technological implementations in adiabatic quantum simulation and computing. Its specific goal is to develop a comprehensive set of non-adiabatic building blocks that replace the adiabatic state preparation by non-adiabatic processes using shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA). This fundamentally new paradigm allows one to detach from the adiabatic limit, which currently hinders practical applications, by introducing additional unitary quantum operations to the system. In this promising approach, only early theory work and simplistic experiments exist so far. In a joint effort of leading European experimental and theory groups, the project will demonstrate (i) the first two-body STA experiment with a scalable architecture, (ii) the first STA experiment with a non-scale-invariant system, (iii) a novel theoretical framework for STA of statistical ensembles and (iv) a novel tensor network framework for STA. The subproject proposed in this application exploits the longstanding experience of WMI on the design, fabrication, and measurement of superconducting quantum circuits in order to implement aspect (i).

This is the result of different historical and institutional contexts. However, these EMS are united by the common aim of providing timely care to victims of sudden and life-threatening emergencies or disasters in cross-border settings and international humanitarian missions. Fostering the response capacities and increasing the cooperation of the Emergency Medical Services Systems (EMSS) is of decisive importance for strengthening the resilience of European societies.  During the prior iProcureSecurity project, a large number of EMS were involved to identify, evaluate and prioritise future challenges and needs. The creation of an interoperable, flexible triage management system supported by modern technologies was among the most requested solutions in the context of security-related scenarios. This iProcureSecurity PCP action is a result of those intense participatory consultation processes. The action will lead to an innovative triage management system that provides a) quick and accurate overview of victims and their status; b) decision support for better allocation of available resources and quicker support for patients; c) improved interoperability with other first responders and relevant actors; d) reduced handover times between ambulance transport and hospitals; and e) insights for quality assurance and training measures.  Following the EC Guidelines on Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP), through a competitive series of design, prototype and pilot steps, the iProcureSecurity PCP will contract suppliers to deliver the creation and deployment of the envisaged triage management system.

We will therefore “cast the net wide” focusing on several VBDs and vector groups to explore synergistic opportunities for integrated and cost-effective approaches to optimize surveillance, prevention and control of VBDs.  Specifically, we will address three vector groups (mosquitoes, ticks and snails) and a range of their diverse VBDs (Rift Valley Fever, ehrlichiosis, theileriosis and fasciolosis), to advance a broad, conceptual knowledge reaching beyond specific VBDs. We believe that only through a better understanding of what enables theVBDs and vectors to persist in their areas of origin, how they manage to spread or what allows some VBDs to successfully span the entire global North-South climatic gradient – will we gain the insights and actionable knowledge that enables us to predict the potential of VBDs to spread and establish in new areas.  PREPARE will establish a truly multidisciplinary network of partner institutions in Europe and Africa, including leading capacities in mosquito- tick- and snail-borne diseases of livestock and humans. The partners cover a wide range of disciplines such as vector ecology, molecular biology, bioinformatics, metagenomics, climate change and predictive spatio-temporal modelling, epidemiology and One Health. Our suggested approach is proactive, focusing on better prevention of tick-, mosquito- and snail-borne diseases of livestock and humans, by increasing disease knowledge in Africa, developing improved tools for rapid detection and state-of-art model-based surveillance for early detection and forecasting to form a blueprint for best practices for optimized VBD surveillance strategies for the targeted diseases

Autophagy requires functional lysosomes to work. In fact, the material to be degraded is engulfed into vesicles called autophagosomes, which fuse with the lysosomes whose enzymes allow degradation. In the Sanfilippo syndrome the autophagic process is impaired as the autophagosomes cannot fuse with the lysosomes. This dysfunction triggers the neurodegenerative processes observed in Sanfilippo syndrome. We have recently shown that one of the mechanisms underlying this dysfunction is caused by abnormal accumulation of amyloid proteins, such as alpha-synuclein. This accumulation occurs in close proximity to the lysosomes, thus preventing them from being transported for fuse with the autophagosomes. When a mouse model of Sanfilippo A is treated with an amyloid protein aggregation inhibitor, autophagy is efficiently re-activated and neurodegenerative processes prevented. How amyloid aggregation impair the transport of lysosomes and thus the completion of autophagy is unclear. In this research proposal we want to understand these mechanisms, testing the hypothesis that alpha-synuclein, the main component of amyloid deposits, directly interacts with the membrane of lysosomes causing their abnormal clustering, which in turns reduces their availability for autophagosome fusion. To test this hypothesis, we will work both in a ""cell-free"" system (i.e. reconstituted in vitro) and in primary neurons derived from Sanfilippo A mice. The results generated by this research proposal could open new avenues for the treatment of Sanfilippo syndrome."

Skin erosions appear at birth or soon after, are very severe and can last several years, resulting in recurrent infections. This disease is caused by genetic defects in p63, a crucial regulator of the skin. This project aims at testing two treatments for the skin lesions. For the first one we will use the CRISPR/CAS9 technology, the molecular scissors for which the Nobel prize has been awarded in 2020, to correct the DNA. In this case the correction is permanent but requires a biopsy, expansion in vitro of epidermal cells, genetic correction, and reimplantation on the wounds. The second treatment is with novel drugs that we recently identified in a large screening. The efficacy, toxicity and mode-of-action of these drugs will be tested in simple in vitro models, in a mouse model for the disease, and in human epidermal cells. The combination of studies in human cells derived from patients and in mouse model using different approaches will be instrumental to design novel therapies for this untreatable disease.

However, global biodiversity remains a largely unexploited resource for natural bioactive molecules with an enormous potential for developing commercial products with public health benefits. Micro and macroalgae, found in marine and freshwater, have been identified as promising sources of bioactive compounds including small molecules and secondary metabolites with a wide range of bioactivities as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cancer preventive. Consumption of algae could, therefore, provide defence against chronic inflammatory diseases such as IBD, that until date have no effective cure. This project offers nature to bedside approach, using an entire development along the value chain for a new biodiscovery therapeutic approach by developing and examining algae-based compounds for IBD patients while guaranteeing algae's biodiversity preservation. We propose innovative solutions for increasing the use of algae-based ingredients and to ensure the science-based improvement of nutritional quality and its effect on public health.

However, today’s bioprinting has no means to actively steer cell behaviour and morphogenesis, leaving yet unfulfilled the potential to fully capture organ functions. Challenging this current perspective, ENLIGHT merges synthetic biology, 3D printing, and photonics to develop a radically new technological concept termed optogenetic volumetric bioprinting. This ultra-fast technique uses visible light tomography to sculpt cells and biomaterials into multi-material, high-resolution, centimetre-scale living tissues within less than a minute. Through synthetic biology-inspired strategies, stem cells gain the ability to sense and respond to light patterns provided by the printer and differentiate into selected cell types, essentially permitting for the first time to 3D print cell functions. ENLIGHT targets two breakthroughs: the development of a volumetric bioprinter capable of optogenetic stimulation to instruct cell fate, and its application to build physiological-scale tissues and organoids that replicate human organ-level functionality. As proof-of-concept ENLIGHT will print vascularized endocrine pancreas models that exhibit native-like function. ENLIGHT will introduce a technology for bioprinting a new generation of reliable user-customizable in vitro models to study human biology and pathology. This is urgently needed to advance drug discovery, personalized medicine and to aid the transition to animal-free biomedical research. These results and the actions of industrial, academic and social science consortium partners, will lay the foundation to build market opportunities, leading research and innovation capacity across Europe.

COEVOLVE will: 1) investigate the relationship between the availability of trace metals and microbial functional diversity in extant ecosystems and organisms; 2) link metabolic diversity and metal availability to different geological, geochemical, and mineralogical conditions; 3) link metabolic diversity and dependence on metal availability to the emergence and evolution of different metabolisms; and 4) determine the timing of major steps in metabolic evolution and link them to geochemical proxies of planetary surface redox change. Understanding the role of trace metal environmental distribution and availability in influencing microbial functional diversity might hold the key to understanding the co-evolution of life and our planet, unlocking a number of important discoveries at the core of diverse fields such as earth sciences, astrobiology, microbial ecology, and biotechnology.

The remarkable superiority of polyploids has been noticed plant breeders, who have used this trait in different approaches in order to obtain increasingly improved plant cultivars.  Moreover, polyploidization is likely to be one of the most important mechanisms of sympatric speciation. All seed plants have experienced at least one round of whole genome duplication in their evolutionary history. The formation of polyploid plants within diploid populations tends to be isolated events. And even when a polyploid individual is formed, to reproduce it will cross with diploids, and this match is unsuccessful for the existence of the “triploid block”, a critical biological barrier in the production of viable seeds. Many species are sensitive to triploid seed production, but not all. Little is known about how polyploid plants were formed in nature and the way that triploid block has emerged in plants. Therefore, understanding of the genetic network controlling the triploid block will be fundamental since this is a preliminary step in the generation of polyploids. Here we propose: i) to study natural and recently synthesized polyploid series of several species that have been extensively characterized in the past few decades from the physiological, reproductive and ecological aspects; ii) to fill the gaps in the information on non-model species regarding: chromosomal changes, gene loss, gene expression, methylation and physiological changes and ecological features and iii) to understand the genetic network controlling the triploid block viability. The overall goal of the proposal is to allow for a synergy of inter-related European and international expertise to better understand the mechanisms of polyploidization and to facilitate the application of this increased knowledge in plant breeding.

State-of-the-art perovskite solar cells outperform established technologies with the advantage of processing from solution. Solution-processed perovskite solar cells are made spraying a precursor ink onto a substrate: the perovskite forms as the chemicals contained in the ink crystallize. This production process makes halide perovskites a valid low-cost alternative established material such as silicon. Furthermore, halide perovskite can work in tandem with silicon to break the theoretical power conversion efficiency limit of 33% according to the Shockley-Queisser model.  However, the most effective photovoltaic perovskites contain more than 10% by weight of lead, which overstep the limits adopted in most of the countries to regulate the use of heavy metals in electronics.  The FREENERGY project aims at achieving efficient and cost-effective lead-free perovskites replacing lead (Pb) with tin (Sn). We have demonstrated that tin is relatively inert if dispersed in the environment as compared to lead, which is prone to enter into plants and thus into the food chain. This solution does not present any manufacturing issue, as making tin-based perovskite is very similar to make lead-based perovskite. The main obstacle is represented by the low chemical stability of Sn2+, which is very prone to be oxidized to Sn4+. We have identified three key strategies:  •	Inorganic cations: We found that organic cations comprising perovskite are more prone than inorganic in to activate the Sn oxidation. We have selected a series of inorganic cations comprising Cs and K to replace the organics most commonly used. •	Alternative solvents: dimethyl sulfoxide is currently used to synthesize the perovskite, but it contributes to the oxidation. We identified alternative solvents to overcome this issue. •	Reducing additives: The perovskite materials are deposited from a solution comprising the precursor of the materials and the solvents.

This project will develop specific strategies to promote an understanding of cultural tourism, which moves away from a “stop-and-go” consumer-oriented approach towards one that puts humans and circular economy models at its centre, paying attention to nature, communities and cultural diversity. “Place”, intended as the genius loci, the ancient spirit of the site and “people” as co-creators of its uniqueness, culture, art, tradition, folklore, productivity, spirituality, are the focus of Be.CULTOUR. Wide and diversified partnerships of stakeholders from 18 EU and non-EU regions of Northern-Central and Southern Europe, the Balkans, the Eastern neighbourhood and the Mediterranean, will be the driving force of the project. A community of 300 innovators (which includes regional authorities and municipalities, clusters and associations, museums and tourist boards, entrepreneurs, chambers of commerce, citizens, researchers, practitioners as well as project partners) in 6 pilot regions will co-create innovative place-based solutions for human-centred and circular cultural tourism. Collaborative “Heritage innovation networks” will be established in 6 European deprived remote, peripheral and deindustrialised areas and cultural landscapes identified as “pilot heritage sites”: committed to the project’s objectives, they have defined clear cultural tourism related challenges requiring innovation, which will serve as the basis for the collaboration with 12 additional “mirror ecosystems”.

The extrapulmonary dissemination of TB involves requires a crucial virulence factor designated as heparin-binding haemaglutinin adhesin (HBHA). HBHA is a 28 kDa dimeric protein localised at the surface of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)  that binds dextran sulphate, dermatan sulphate, glycosaminoglycans and heparan-sulphate proteoglycans thus mediating the adhesion with epithelial cells and to extracellular matrix components. Despite a crucial role in the dissemination of TB, a key relevance as strong diagnostic antigen and as therapeutic target, there is currently limited understanding of the structure and mechanism of action of HBHA.  The ambitious aim of this proposal is to characterise at high-resolution the mechanisms of function of HBHA in different phases of the life cycle of MTB. To achieve this ambitious target, we will carry out an integrated investigation of solution-state and solid-state NMR nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to acquire high-resolution data on the interaction of HBHA with membranes of MTB.   The NMR experiments will be complemented with biophysical studies and mutagenesis to accurately define the relationship between structure, dynamics and function of HBHA.  Our preliminary data suggest that this ambitious project comes at the most opportune time as we now have tools, materials and knowledge to resolve this important goal for biochemistry and reveal the propeties of a crucial molecule for the mechanism of extrapulmonary dissemination of TB.

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against immune checkpoint molecules (ICIs), such as PD-1, have revolutionized the therapeutic approach of several tumors, including advanced melanoma. However, a large proportion (≅45%) of patients still fail to respond to anti-PD-1 monotherapy. Therefore, the identification of predictive factors of response is a top priority in clinical oncology. Neutrophils are key players of the acute phase of inflammation and resistance against pathogens. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were first described as extracellular fibers of DNA and decorating proteins responsible for trapping and killing extracellular pathogens. Increasing evidences now indicate multiple roles for neutrophils and NETs in the scenario of cancer-related inflammation. However, rigorous evidence demonstrating the role of neutrophils and NETs in melanoma and in predicting the response to ICIs is missing.  We hypothesize that neutrophils and NETs play pivotal roles in melanoma, can be modulated by tumor-derived soluble mediators and may take part in the ICI-related immune response to melanoma. Moreover, our preliminary data allow us to hypothesize that neutrophils and NETs can provide useful theranostic biomarkers to assist oncologists in the selection of appropriate patient-tailored treatments.  The long-term aim of this proposal is to characterize the roles played by neutrophils and NETs in human melanoma and in response to ICIs.  The project includes four complementary but not contingent Work-Packages. WP1: Immune profiling of melanoma patients before and during ICI therapy. Neutrophils will be purified from peripheral blood of advanced melanoma patients before and during ICI therapy, to evaluate multiple phenotypical and functional aspects. WP 2: Cross-talk between neutrophils and melanoma cells before and during ICI therapy. We will investigate in vitro the biological mechanisms responsible for the modulation of neutrophil biological properties by melanoma cells. WP 3: In vitro and ex vivo pro- or anti-tumorigenic role of NETs in advanced melanoma. We will investigate whether NETs play a pro- or an anti-tumorigenic role in melanoma patients. WP 4: In vivo role of neutrophils and NETs in melanoma and immunotherapy response. We will take advantage of an in vivo melanoma model of genetically modified mice to investigate the role of neutrophils and NETs in the different phases of melanoma initiation and progression. Genetic and pharmacologic depletion of neutrophils and NETs will allow assessing their contribution to ICI therapeutic response.  We expect to identify neutrophil-related biomarkers to predict the response to ICIs in melanoma patients. In addition, in vivo pharmacological and genetic deficiency of neutrophils in the mouse melanoma model will provide direct demonstration of the contribution of neutrophils to the therapeutic response to ICIs.  The results from these translational studies could lead to the identification of neutrophil-related biomarkers predictive for immunotherapy response in melanoma. In prospect, our study may contribute to achieve tailored immunotherapy in melanoma patients, avoiding unnecessary and costly treatments to non-responsive patients.

Currently available diagnostic kits are based on antibodies or peptides. Oligonucleotide aptamers provide a valuable alternative to antibodies allowing highly specific recognition combined with chemical stability, low production costs, easy control of folding and possibility to introduce chemical modifications without reducing target specificity. We are currently investigating G-quadruplex (G4)-forming aptamers selective towards VEGF165 and HMGB1, overexpressed in several tumour types. These aptamers, fully characterized in solution, tightly and specifically recognize their targets when structured in peculiar, stable G4 foldings. In order to measure protein levels in liquid biological samples, solid supports functionalized with G4-forming aptamers specific for a target protein - coupled with fluorescence-based detection methods - can be particularly advantageous, allowing easy separation and quantification of bound molecules. These biosensors would ensure high recognition specificity, simple operation mode, optimal sensitivity and low costs. In fact, the possibility to reuse the G4-functionalzed supports for multiple experiments can be envisaged, considering the easy control and reversibility of G4-forming aptamers self-assembly. Oligonucleotides can fold into their preferred secondary structures even when linked to Controlled Pore Glass (CPG) beads, so we expect that CPG-bound aptamers allow specific protein capturing from complex biological fluids, not requiring extensive pre-treatments. Unspecific binding to the support can be minimized exploiting the aptamer high recognition specificity, CPG chemical inertness and optimized functionalization protocols. We here propose a proof-of-principle for innovative aptamer-based biosensors, based on CPG beads functionalized with G4-forming aptamers specifically recognizing peculiar proteins overexpressed in common primary tumours (e.g., breast cancer, melanoma, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, mesothelioma), so to facilitate early diagnosis and high-fidelity prognosis. These biosensors can provide a simple, reliable and less expensive alternative to antibodies. VEGF165 and HMGB1 will be selected as model proteins in this study. To target these proteins, we recently developed brand new G4-based aptamers (HMGB1), or provided conspicuous new knowledge on known G4-based aptamers (VEGF165). These oligonucleotides, properly immobilized on ad hoc functionalized CPG, will be used to fish the target proteins. The proteins captured by the CPG-bound aptamers will be then released in solution via competition experiments with fluorescently labelled aptamers, whose fluorescence changes observed upon protein binding allow determining the protein concentration. Cellular extracts from both cancer and healthy cell lines will be tested first, and then, after a careful optimization work, real human samples from bodily fluids. The proof-of-principle - once validated on VEGF and HMGB1 - will be then extended to other relevant cancer biomarkers. We aim at developing a novel methodology based on support-bound, G4-forming aptamers to easily and rapidly detect specific protein biomarkers in cell extracts as well as in real liquid biological samples, from both cancer and healthy patients, using simple fluorescence measurements. Simple, accessible and inexpensive methods to rapidly quantitate cancer-related biomarkers is of the utmost importance for early diagnosis and prognosis of cancer, allowing the most appropriate targeted therapies, of paramount impact on cancer, and improving both clinical or economic outcomes.

Its recent increased frequency and the limited choice of treatment for advanced cSCC cause a serious health and economic concern. Current treatments need to be implemented. Work from many laboratories including our own has indicated that dysregulation of the transcriptional network centered on p63 -the master regulator of epidermal development- is required for oncogenic function in cSCC. In our preliminary results we identified that PARP1 and the nuclear kinase ULK3 are p63-associated proteins, whose expression is markedly elevated in cSCC. Depletion of either PARP1 or ULK3 leads to reduced proliferative potential of tumor propagating cells. We propose that these enzymes play critical roles in keratinocyte oncogenic conversion as part of the p63 transcriptional network, with a key function in controlling transcription and chromatin modifications.  We will define the molecular mechanisms underlying PARP1 and ULK3 effects on maintaining cell proliferative potential/survival in cSCC and test specific strategies for novel therapeutic intervention. Toward these goals, we will address the following aims:  1. Exploring the molecular mechanisms through which PARP1 and its enzymatic activity regulate cell proliferation, cell division and survival in cSCC by functional interaction with p63, and regulation of the oncogenic transcriptional co-activators YAP.  2. Investigating the ULK3 control of transcription and chromatin organisation in cSCC, in normal epidermis and in UV-mediated skin carcinogenesis. 3. Test the hypothesis that PARP1 and ULK3 are targets of translational significance for the remission of advanced cSCC.   Biochemical, molecular and epigenetic approaches as well as in vivo microscopy imaging will be used to test the specific function of PARP1 and ULK3 in cSCC cell lines, primary cSCC, and normal human keratinocytes. Using an inducible mouse model, we will explore ULK3 function in normal epidermis, as well as ULK3 impact in UV-mediated skin carcinogenesis, thereby determining whether ULK3 is a target of translational significance. Pharmacological inhibition of PARP1 or ULK3 alone or in combination with other recently developed cancer inhibitors will be tested for clonogenic capacity, oncosphere formation, and orthotopic tumor formation. The effect of sequential administration versus concurrent treatment will be also tested to reduce toxicity.  This project is expected to lead to a significant advancement on the current ability to target the p63 transcriptional network for therapeutic intervention in cSCC. Even though PARP1 has been extensively studied as a potential target  in other cancers, its function in cSCC has not been explored. Similarly, the function of the ULK3/p63 interaction is entirely novel and its possible role in cSCC therapy is unknown. The best possible drug combination leading to the maximal lethal effect on cSCC while maintaining tolerability for normal cells will be indentified The project impact lies in the entirely novel strategies to target cSCC addiction to the p63 transcriptional program, by targeting enzymes regulating this program with specific inhibitors alone or in combination with other state-of-the-art treatment.

The relatively high stability of miRNAs in biofluids such as plasma, serum, urine, and saliva has positioned miRNAs as promising noninvasive new biomarkers for cancer diagnostic. Despite the recognized role of miRNAs deregulation in cancer onset and progression, the evaluation of blood miRNAs profile is still far from being introduced into the clinical routine. In recent years, our working group  has developed a new type of detection system capable to directly measure miRNAs in specific and ultra-sensitive way according to a multiplex approach. The proof of principle of this approach will be attempted to develop a Lab-on-chip device for miRNAs-based cancer diagnosis.  The main hypothesis of the present proposal is that miRNAs are yet considered insufficient for clinical applications due to the lack of a robust detection method. A precise, fast and easy to use technology needs to be exploited in order to finally recognize miRNAs as realistic cancer diagnostic biomarkers. The global aim of the project is the development and validation of a Lab-on-chip device for miRNA quantification directly in biological samples from cancer patients. Our specific goals are: 1) development of advanced biosensors for specific and sensitive miRNAs detection and quantification; 2) development of a microfluidic chip and integration with biosensors to performs miRNAs multiplexed detection in fluorescence; 3) proof of most accurate and reproducible methods than current ones for miRNAs quantification; 4) validation of the method in clinical samples. The experimental workflow will comprise: synthesis of bioinspired novel materials (microgels); selection of a set of upregulated miRNAs in various cancer types; design of miRNAs specific oligonucleotide probes; fabrication of a microfluidic chip in which integrate biosensors to measure miRNAs levels in biological fluids; evaluation of upregulated miRNA in vitro (cancer cell cultures), in vivo (cancer mouse models) and ex-vivo (sera and urines from cancer patients) models of different cancers and along with comparison with current methods analysis (qRT-PCR); Implementation of statistical models for Lab-on-chip and qRT-PCR data analysis and comparison. The main expected results are to: 1) demonstrate that our method can perform an automated, cost effective and reliable quantification without the need of extraction and amplification steps; 2) validate miRNA Lab-on-chip with adequate multiplexing abilities coupled to low limit of detection and high dynamic range of detection; 3) demonstrate that miRNA Lab-on-chip tool is most reproducible, accurate with lower assay variability than current miRNAs quantification methods.  Our approach could satisfy the growing need to accurately and easily measure circulating miRNAs. The integration of Lab-on chip assay and definition of a set of upregulated miRNAs in clinical samples could open the way for wider clinical studies to define miRNAs profiles for a personalized medicine. By proposed approach an early detection of cancer and monitoring for disease recurrence or progression after treatment could be possible. This could have a significant impact on cancer diagnosis and treatment, thus reducing morbidity and mortality.

The compelling evidence that such noncanonical structures act as active regulators of cancer-related genomic processes made them an emerging research topic and an attractive target for gene regulation and anticancer drug design. Formation, stabilization, and resolution of such noncanonical structures are regulated by nucleic acid-directed proteins that can activate/deactivate specific pathways. Despite their importance, the identity of most of these proteins remain unknown, as well as how they work and what is their biological impact on cancer cells. The identification of the proteins that specifically recognize noncanonical structures is crucial to understand the elusive molecular mechanisms in which such DNA motifs are involved, with important implications also in the field of drug discovery. This project aims to identify and investigate the nuclear proteins able to selectively recognize G-quadruplex and i-motif structures in the same transcriptional regulatory element of selected cancer-related human gene promoters. Starting from the identified proteins, this project also aims to develop peptides/peptidomimetics able to target such DNA structures with high affinity and selectivity, as well as lower toxicity and increased functionality compared to the traditional small molecule drugs. The identification of the interactors of the selected gene promoter i-motifs and G-quadruplexes will be achieved in a direct fashion by a chemical proteomics approach that we have already proven to be a successful strategy. A combined use of biophysical and biological experiments will be employed to investigate the selected proteins and understand their role, as well as to study the properties of the developed peptides. We expect to identify the proteins that specifically recognize the G-quadruplex and i-motif structures in the same location of the genome and to characterize their interaction from a structural and functional point of view. Then, by exploiting the noncanonical DNA-recognition motifs of the discovered proteins, we expect to obtain peptide-based anticancer agents combining the advantages of therapeutic proteins and small-molecule drugs. The discovery of the nuclear proteins that specifically recognize noncanonical DNA structures and the elucidation of their functions will contribute to expand the knowledge on these structures and their roles in cancer, and to shed light on the complex regulatory mechanisms of gene expression. Moreover, our findings will have a significant impact in the field of drug discovery. Indeed, we will exploit the molecular determinants of these protein-DNA interactions to develop in 5 years' time a new generation of molecularly targeted anticancer therapeutics.

However, for patients with mutations in large genes, including two genes most frequently mutated in IRD, i.e. EYS and USH2A, clinical translation is hampered due to the limited cargo capacity of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, the current vector of choice in retinal gene therapy. The aim of our proposal is to address this limitation in two ways. First, we will develop alternative therapeutic approaches, which includes the modulation of the splicing machinery and the implementation of therapeutic genome editing approaches using state-of-the-art methods like AON-based splicing modulation, PRIME-editing and newly identified Cas protein variants. Second, we will optimize novel larger vehicles that can ensure a proper delivery of EYS and USH2A coding sequences to the retina, including an intein-based multiple AAV approach, newly identified adenoviral vectors and latest versions of nanoparticles. To remain as close as possible to the patient population, we will mostly employ human cellular model systems, i.e. well-established cell lines and induced pluripotent stem cell-based retinal organoids. Where necessary and justified, we will also employ the zebrafish and the pig as two in vivo systems relevant to disease pathology. Since the partners in the GET READY consortium are at different stages of their career, the close interaction with each other will likely enable the establishment of new ideas and lead to disruptive scientific developments. A close connection to patient advocacy organizations in many partner countries will ensure dissemination of the results to raise awareness of these developments for patients with EYS and USH2A mutations. A successful outcome of GET-READY will significantly advance the development of novel treatment approaches for a non-negligible patient population, and consequently help to improve the life-quality of these patients as well as reduce the socio-economic burden due to progressive vision loss.

The project has three vertical objectives: •	exploring and advancing a non-conventional semi-solid-state Li-ion battery material formulation suit-able for structural batteries: NMC622 (cathode), Si/C (anode) and bicontinuous polymer-ionic liquid electrolyte (BCE), i.e. NMC622-BCE-Si/C; •	enabling the functional integration of this material within the CCF and RMS concepts, upscaling them to the level of a representative aeronautic stiffened panel structure, i.e. SOLIFLY demonstrator; •	characterising the electrochemical and mechanical performance of this demonstrator.  These vertical objectives are complemented with a horizontal one: to tailor SOLIFLY to the needs of the aeronautic industry. This is achieved by factoring end-user requirements and specifications into the design process right from the start, and by including airworthiness and manufacturing criteria together with a technology roadmap and TRL scale-up strategy. The SOLIFLY demonstrator aims at achieving a gravimetric energy density at cell level between 100 and 180 Wh/kg, a nominal discharge rate of 1C, being capable of sustaining 300+ cycles at 0.1C with 90% capacity retention and achieving TRL 4 by the end of the project (2023).   SOLIFLY ultimately aims at supporting the long-term development of the European aeronautic industry, delivering the first aeronautic stiffened panel with an integrated semi-solid-state battery, and paving the way for making structural batteries a viable technology for the next generation hybrid electric airliner.

It will create an Energy sustainability management framework collecting data from the factory and holistically process them to create dedicated energy sustainability metrics. These values will be used to predict energy trends using industrial processes, equipment and energy cost models. ENERMAN will deliver an autonomous, intelligent decision support engine that will evaluate the predicted trends and access if they match predefined energy consumption sustainability KPIs. If the KPIs are not met, ENERMAN will suggest and implement changes in energy affected production lines control processes: an energy aware flexible control loop on various factory processes will be deployed. The ENERMAN administrators will be able to use the above mechanisms in order to identify how future changes in the production lines can impact energy sustainability using the ENERMAN prediction engine (based on digital twins) to visualize possible sustainability results when in-factory changes are made in equipment, production line. The ENERMAN digital twin will predict the economic cost of the consumed energy based on the collected and predicted Energy Peak load tariff, Renewable Energy System self-production, the variations in demand response, possible virtual generation and prosumer aggregation. Finally, ENERMAN considers the operators actions within the production chain as part of a factory’s energy fingerprint since their activity within the factory impacts the various production lines. In ENERMAN, we include a training mechanism with suggested personnel good practices for energy sustainability improvement through the production lines. Current and predicted energy consumption/sustainability trends on specific assets of the factory are collected and visualized in a Virtual, eXtended reality model of the factory to enhance the situational energy awareness of the factory personnel.
100|grant.9471250|EP/V011820/1|UKRI Interdisciplinary Circular Economy Centre For Mineral-based Construction Materials|UKRI Interdisciplinary Circular Economy Centre For Mineral-based Construction Materials|177 million tonnes of virgin aggregates, 15 million tonnes of cement and 2 billion bricks were used to build houses, civic and commercial buildings, roads and railways, etc, in the UK in 2016. Meanwhile, 64 million tonnes of waste arose from construction and demolition. Materials from construction and demolition are mainly managed by down-cycling with loss of the value imparted to them by energy-intensive and polluting manufacturing processes; for example, high value concrete is broken down into low value aggregate. Environmental damage is associated with the whole linear life cycles of mineral-based construction materials, and includes scarring of the landscape and habitat destruction when minerals are extracted from the earth; depletion of mineral and energy resources; and water use and emission of greenhouse gases and other pollutants to air, land and water, during extraction, processing, use and demolition. It is important to take action now, to return materials to the resource loop in a Circular Economy, and reduce the amount of extraction from the earth, as the amount we build increases each year. For example, the UK plans spend £600 billion to build infrastructure in the next decade.  The UKRI National Interdisciplinary Circular Economy Research Centre for Mineral-based Construction Materials therefore aims to do more with less mineral-based construction materials, to reduce costs to industry, reduce waste and pollution, and benefit the natural environment that we depend on. There is potential for mineral-based construction materials to be reused and recycled at higher value, for example, by refurbishing rather than demolishing, or by building using reusable modules that can be taken apart rather than demolished, so all the energy that went into making them isn't wasted. It may also be possible to substitute minerals from natural sources by other types of mineral wastes, such as the 76 million tonnes of waste arising from excavation and quarrying, 14 million tonnes of mineral wastes that come from other industries, or 4 billion tonnes of historical mining wastes. We can also be more frugal in our use of mineral-based construction materials, by designing materials, products and structures to use less primary raw materials, last longer, and be suitable for repurposing rather than demolition, and using new manufacturing techniques.  First, our research will try to better understand how mineral-based construction materials flow through the economy, over all the stages of their life cycle, including extraction, processing, manufacture, and end-of-life. The Centre will work to support the National Materials Database planned by the Office of National Statistics, which will capture how, where and when materials are used and waste arises, so that we have the information to improve this system. We will also study how any changes we might make to practices around minerals use would affect the environment and the economy, such as greenhouse gas emissions, costs to businesses, or jobs. Second, we will work on technical improvements that we can make in design of mineral-based products and structures, and in all the life-cycle stages of mineral-based construction materials. Third, we will look at how changes in current business models and practices could support use of less mineral-based construction materials, such as how they might be able to move more quickly to new technologies, or how they might use digital technologies to keep track of materials. We will explore how the government can support these changes, and how we can provide education so that everyone working in this system understands what they need to do.  In the first 4 years of our Centre, 15 postdoctoral researchers will gain research experience working in the universities for 2y and will then work with an industrial collaborator for a year, to implement the results of their research. More than 20 PhD and 30 MSc students will also be trained in the Centre.

The AERO-TRAIN general objectives are, in fact, to reduce the costs associated to O&M operations, while increasing the safety aspects related to the asset management. To achieve its objectives, AERO-TRAIN researches and develops automation technologies based on aerial manipulators and it identifies that the solution lays in the synergy between three main research pillars: Intelligent Mechatronics, Artificial Intelligence and Human-Machine Interaction. AERO-TRAIN will focus on developing new approaches for improving the robustness of aerial manipulators under conditions that reflect real application, such as the application of relevant forces for tool manipulation and robust perception in featureless and light challenging environments. Moreover, AERO-TRAIN takes a unique human-centered direction and it addresses the scientific issues related to increasing the maneuverability for remote aerial manipulation by development new immersive technologies, augmented and mixed reality for damage assessment by a remote expert, and collaborative human-machine intelligence for supported evaluation of criticalities. Finally, AERO-TRAIN addresses the lack of skills and competences that are needed in the industry to ensure that the outcome of the project create an impact, by developing a training program where both the academic and non-academic sector contribute to train 15 Early Stage Researchers that are hosted by 9 beneficiaries that are experts in the AERO-TRAIN core technologies, and 7 partner organizations that partners from both industry and academia will complement the framework for the training, advancement and test of the technology.

The European Parliament has called for investment on these sectors, but so far complex fluid processes in these industries are far from understood, as the research has generally been small scale and/or technologically flawed. In particular: the poor understanding of yield-stress fluid rheology and linking of the measured parameters to the yield properties and insufficient models, means that applications are designed without the understanding of even the basic flow properties (no-flow zones, pressure needed to initiate flow), which introduces uncertainties and errors; there is a serious shortage of research trained professionals who combine expertise on complex fluid research, technology and industrial needs. In conjunction with ESR the largest network in Europe in rheology, this ITN will: develop a European multi-disciplinary, intersectoral educational research framework for Europe, to comprehensively train 12 early stage researchers (ESRs) to PhD level; provide the research evidence to show how modern measurement and modelling methods may improve the cost- and resource-efficiency of industrial processes; provide the European workforce with a much needed new generation of excellent research trained professionals. The scientific objectives of YIELDGAP covered by the 4 research workpackages are to: establish advanced and highly improved numerical modelling tools of complex fluids including additives; validate models by lab and field measurements; integrate measured fluid properties with model parameters; build and disseminate best practices for industry and academia. Using advanced methods where the YIELDGAP partners are world leading, the work of this ITN will culminate in international consensus guidelines for yield-stress fluid flow measurement and prediction.

The personal robotics domain presents several research challenges mainly related to the need for a high degree of personalization of the robot behaviour with respect to the specific user’s needs and preferences. Companies need to build solutions rooted in a deeper analysis of humans’ specificities before developing products for people. At the same time, academia needs to nurture the development of an extended research community with a set of interdisciplinary skills to investigate different robot’s capabilities for understanding and modelling the interaction with human beings, for adapting the robot’s behaviour to the context, and software integration mechanisms that allow an easy personalized configuration approach to limit the static and costly customization processes of a novel robotic system. The PERSEO’s research program is organized into three Research Themes aimed at investigating personalization of robot capabilities at different levels of possible human-robot interaction, namely “Physical”, “Cognitive”, and “Social”. This requires a set of research skills ranging from computer science and AI to automation, ethics, and psychology. Fellows will deepen their knowledge in projects covering a specific research theme but, through training events, secondments, and peer collaborations will gain extensive knowledge in other areas so leading to a multidisciplinary research programme and the integration with other projects to achieve the proposed Integration Milestones. The project also aims at training Early Stage Researchers to address social, legal, and ethical issues that arise by the uptake of personal robots, as such skills are fundamental to achieve technological innovation which aligns with European social, ethical al legal values.
100|grant.9425301|188757|A new probabilistic framework for regional volcanic risk assessment including hazards interacting at multiple temporal and spatial scales|A new probabilistic framework for regional volcanic risk assessment including hazards interacting at multiple temporal and spatial scales|Hazards arising from volcanic eruptions have longer durations than other natural hazard events and can reach further than any other hazard. The multiple temporal and spatial scales of eruption impacts can be highly disruptive, but the availability of precursors before eruptions provides opportunities for at-risk communities to mitigate their effects. We propose to develop a framework for volcanic risk assessment by advancing current FNS-research on understanding impacts of the 2011 Cordón Caulle eruption in Argentina. Our framework will evolve from local impact studies to risk analysis at a regional scale that includes multiple hazards and vulnerability dimensions. The research team consists of a mix of existing and new collaborations and will fund two PhD students (Subprojects A and B) and 4 years of Postdoctoral research (Subproject C).Motivation: Despite the far-reaching effects of eruptions, an integrated framework for volcanic risk assessment that combines multiple hazards with multiple dimensions of vulnerability (e.g., physical, socio-economic, systemic) and of mitigation and resilience capacity does not exist. This helps to explain the large number of victims of eruptions despite our increased understanding of eruptive and human dynamics and monitoring capacity. Additionally, and given the increase of population exposure and systemic vulnerability, eruptions have the potential to increase their impacts in future events. Our new framework will assess risk associated with future eruptions in a given region and identify the main areas needing intervention in order to reduce risk in thematically key economic sectors (e.g. food production, civil aviation, built environment). Goal and specific objectives: The main goal of the proposed project is the development of a new framework for risk assessment that will be tested on the Central and Southern Volcanic Zones of the Andes (CVZ and SVZ) located between Chile and Argentina. The framework has global applicability, as hazards associated with CVZ and SVZ are representative of those in most other volcanic regions of the world. Main specific objectives are to: i) produce a risk-ranking strategy to identify high-impact volcanoes in a region; ii) develop a probabilistic strategy for regional multi-source and multi-process hazard assessment at various temporal and spatial scales; iii) assess exposure, various dimensions of vulnerability, mitigation and resilience capacity; iv) construct dedicated fragility curves and damage scales associated with both individual and compounding hazards; v) compile thematic risk maps combining hazard, exposure and vulnerability data accounting also for the analysis of mitigation and resilience capacity; and vi) co-design the final regional risk assessment in collaboration with local and national institutions.Methods: Our probabilistic multi-hazard assessment will be compiled from field observations and numerical modelling of the three CVZ and SVZ volcanoes with the highest potential impact identified through a new dedicated risk-ranking strategy (Subproject A). The assessment of physical vulnerability will rely on field characterizations of building typology integrated with numerical modelling to adapt and extend the existing fragility curves and damage scales to the study areas (Subproject B). The assessment of systemic vulnerability, mitigation and resilience will rely on field studies, while the socio-economic vulnerability assessment will be based on the analysis of existing datasets combined with new focus groups and in-person interviews (Subproject C). Subproject C will also combine the outcomes of Subprojects A and B to co-design thematic-risk maps in collaboration with local and national institutions and, based on this case study, will develop the new risk-assessment framework.Scientific relevance and broader impact: The project addresses current goals of the international effort for Disaster Risk Reduction by developing an inclusive integrated framework that for the first time combines a probabilistic multi-source and multi-process hazard assessment with exposure, various dimensions of vulnerability and mitigation and resilience capacity. Outcomes will be disseminated mostly through scientific open-access publications, white papers, international conferences, training programs of the University of Geneva and risk-reduction programs of partner institutions (including institutions in Argentina and Chile).

The potential for a hazard to cause a disaster mainly depends on the vulnerability of the exposed community to a particular hazard. According to EM-DAT, for the period 1998–2009, earthquakes in Europe rank second in terms of fatalities and third in terms of overall losses. Further, flooding, along with storms, is the most important natural hazard in Europe in terms of economic losses. Actions and measures, can reduce the economic impact of a hazardous event. Within this context, scholars, government agencies, professional organizations as well as local communities seek to understand the three main stages of a disaster (i.e. Normal/Risk Reduction Stage, Emergency Response Stage, Recovery Stage) and take measures to lower the negative impact. The goal of ISTOS is, by the end of the project, to significantly strengthen the Scientific Excellence and Innovation Capacity of the collaborative Advanced Infrastructures and Materials (AIM) laboratory established at the Frederick Research Center (FRC) and the Large Structures laboratory (LSL) established at the Cyprus University of Technology (CUT). The aim is to turn the collaborative laboratories at FRC and CUT into a Center of Excellence, “ISTOS”, which will be based in Cyprus. The proposed ISTOS project will achieve its goal by creating strong links between the AIM, LSL and two internationally leading research institutions namely the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH) of Greece and the PLINIVS Study Centre, University of Naples Federico II (PLINIVS-LUPT) of Italy. Through ISTOS, the research profile and expertise of the staff, of FRC and CUT, will be raised while at the same time enhancing the S&T capacity of the linked institutions.

Bringing together research, industrial and food authority partners representing the agro-food industry in the EU and China, DiTECT aspires to establish the foundation for future food safety monitoring platforms, through the development of a standards-based, modular, Big Data-enabled  platform, capable of accurately predicting food safety parameters of a given food product based on data collected in real-time via cost-efficient sensors, at crop, grain storage, livestock and finally in the food supply, incorporating blockchain processes. DiTECT integrates multidisciplinary research teams from fields such as microbial and spectroscopic fingerprinting technologies; emerging ICT-based food tracing systems; signal analysis and data mining. Microbial profiling will be attained via conventional microbiological analyses in tandem with advanced molecular methods (e.g., NGS-based metagenomics), while spectroscopic profiling will be based on spectral data generated using appropriate rapid, non-invasive methods and sensor devices. DiTECT recognizes that current food-chains are lacking a complete snapshot view of food safety at the crop/livestock and finished product levels, and so foresees the development of a cloud-enabled storage system for all data corresponding to different insights of product-specific safety aspects, to be integrated into. The novel food safety services will be demonstrated in four (4) real-world Pilots with the active engagement of 21 EU and 13 CN partners, using real datasets to validate efficiency improvements.

HARNESSTOM  aims to demonstrate that increasing use of Genetic Resources is key for food safety and security and can lead to innovation and benefit all stakeholders. By capitalizing on the large effort done recently in several EU-funded projects to connect phenotypes/genotypes in a large number of accessions from different germplasm banks and academia, HARNESSTOM will first collect, centralize  and normalize this wealth of information in a way that is easily searchable and displayed in a user-friendly manner adapted to different type of users. Second, HARNESSTOM will develop four prebreeding programs addressing the major challenges of the field: 1) introducing resistances against major emerging diseases, 2) improving tomato tolerance to climate change, 3) improving quality 4) increasing resilience in traditional European tomato by participatory breeding. And additional goal is to increase speed and efficiency in prebreeding what is needed to be able to respond to the emerging challenges in a timely and effective manner. Joint leadership of both academia and industry in each of the WP and the participation of two NGOs  representing different stakeholders guarantees the results of the project will have an impact in industry innovation and also in the society.

Individuals, groups, and institutions ofvery different nature, such as firms, universities, and even countries, seek to formalliances with the aim of achieving joint profits to be divided among them. This type ofsituations is frequently modeled as coalition formation games. In particular, weconsider problems in which agents have claims over the potential profits which arethemselves insufficient to meet all agents' claims. The aim of this setting is focused onthe study and analysis of the coalitions that will be formed under this kind of rationingsituations. Specifically, we seek patterns in the behavior of the agents that lead us toidentify the stable partitions when the resources of each group are divided according todifferent allocation rules.Secondly, we analyze a social choice problem in which the location of a public facilityshould be decided taking into account agents' preferences. An ideal option would be toconstruct a facility near the locations of the agents that consider the facility a good butfar away from those that consider it a bad. However, preferences are privateinformation and agents may decide to reveal it truthfully or not depending on the ruleselected to aggregate the preferences. The objective of this part of our project is tocharacterize all the rules that give agents incentives to reveal their preferencestruthfully (a property known as strategy-proofness). In particular, we work in a mixeddomain of single-peaked and single-dipped preferences where only the type ofpreference of each agent is known.Thirdly, we propose two variants of the famous Shapley Scarf housing market modelby either allowing for the allocation of multiple objects or by incorporating a limitedform of externality in consumption. In both models, indivisible objects are tradedbetween agents and it is well known that results for the classic Shapley Scarf model donot carry over to model extensions with multiple object types or externalities. We tackleboth these extensions to analyze the robustness and generality of existing results.Different domains of preferences are considered in taking the multi-type as well as theexternality aspects into account (e.g., separable preferences, additive separablepreferences, lexicographic preferences) and results regarding core solutions and relatedsolution concepts (e.g., von Neumann Morgenstern sets) for such housing markets willbe collected.

The goal is to realize a special occasion of meeting and interaction between the public at large and the world of research, where researchers – at the forefront of all the proposed activities – can show themselves and what they do, in a simple, spontaneous, informal and entertaining way, actively involving the public. People, by doing, find themselves learning, getting amused, and becoming aware of how much research is for everyone and all around us. All MEET activities aim at promoting research and its outcomes, researchers and their profession, with a special attention to the youngest generations on one side, and to the recognition of the role of Europe on the other. With one common macro-theme, detailed in five thematic areas and five slogans, MEET proposes interactive stands, hands-on experiments and live demos that reconstruct the research environment; conferences, video projections, interactive games; guided visits to scientific museums; meeting occasions with researchers; European Corners; live broadcast moments. A special attention is given to schools’ pupils, for which a number of dedicated activities are foreseen, at the goal of encouraging them to consider research career as a concrete option for their life, and to sustainability, one of the most important topics to be considered to achieve a better future.

Thus, several research and industrial projects were recently dedicated to the identification of potential REE stocks in Europe. However, the environmental risk exerted by the REE dissemination has so far received very little attention although disruptions of some REE biogeochemical cycles have been already evidenced. In that context, intensive and cooperative intersectoral researches are needed on REE environmental occurrence, behaviour, fate and their respective effects on natural resources (soils, waters and biota) and human health. The PANORAMA project is a unique multi- and interdisciplinary project aiming at (i) investigating the whole REE environmental behaviour including the characterization of sources, speciations and transfers throughout the different environmental compartments and sensu lato associated effects onto environmental health, as well as (ii) gaining valuable knowledge for applications in friendly environmental REE life cycle. For the 1st time PANORAMA gathers the competencies of (geo)chemists, (hydro)geologists and (eco)toxicologists, working in 14 academic and 4 private partners to enroll and train 15 Early Stage Researchers (ESRs). The project will combine training and cutting-edge research tools through coupled field/ analytical/experimental/modeling approaches. The strong blend of academic and non-academic sectors in the consortium will give the ESRs a unique chance to develop a wide set of fundamental research, technical and transferable skills (e.g. research integrity, communication and dissemination, career development and innovative technology), thus preparing them for long-time employment in either the academic, industrial, commercial or policy sectors and pave the way for high-level long-standing intersectoral collaborations within a European framework.

For cells to be visualised by MRI, they generally must be labelled to enable their discrimination from surrounding tissue.  The development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents is therefore an active area of research, where the basis for this interest is the expansion of MRI as a high-resolution and non-invasive important preclinical and clinical imaging modality.  Moreover, there are now new opportunities to developing smart materials with multifunctional abilities including MRI contrast in-built within biomaterial structures, functionalisation with targeting ligands and the carrying of a therapeutic payload. This move towards a new generation of MRI contrast reagents has also been spurred on by the mounting evidence against gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs). They are currently the agents of choice and were considered historically safe and well tolerated until recently.  However, they have been found to accumulate in various tissues of patients who do not have renal impairment, including bone, brain and kidneys. Furthermore, in 2015, the FDA released a new safety announcement regarding GBCAs and the risk of accumulated deposits in the brain following repeated use. Whilst GBCAs are being investigated, they can still be administered but healthcare professionals have been advised to limit the use of GBCA to situations in which contrast is deemed absolutely necessary.This has opened the door to the novelty of using perfluorocarbon (19F) being incorporated inside smart nanoparticles, which can offer unique quantitative signatures for molecular MRI with no competing background signal.

They represent ideal targets for personalized cancer therapies and if appropriately designed they can provide specific, non-toxic and effective therapeutic tools. The identification of novel therapeutic ncRNAs and the design of their appropriate formulation is a key aspect for their clinical applicability. RISE- cONCReTE aims to form an international and inter-sectoral network of organizations working on a joint research programme on the development of a safe ncRNA-based drug. RISE- cONCReTE teams up experts in the fields of Molecular Oncology, Epigenetics, Signal transduction, Animal models, Therapeutic delivery and Imaging, business, and education. The participants will exchange skills, knowledge and staff members that will be exposed to synergetic and complementary research environments. RISE- cONCReTE will undertake an integrated approach to reveal novels functional links between ncRNAs and oncogenic pathways. We will: a) characterize novel classes of tumor-associated ncRNAs; b) investigate the impact of ncRNAs on key aspects of tumor cell biology; c) develop cargoes (e.g. aptamers) for delivering therapeutic ncRNA derivatives into specific cancer cell types. By using innovative in vivo imaging tools, we will monitor the accumulation of target ncRNAs in cancer cells and evaluate their biological efficacy in inhibiting the growth and spreading of malignant tumors. The resulting approaches will provide stable and effective tools thus potentially improving the quality of life (QOL) of the cancer patients. Further, the joint research and training programme of RISE- cONCReTE will be performed in academic institutions and SME to provide a unique interdisciplinary platform for scientists with a significant contribution to EU competitiveness.

The plan is that the end of the Flagship will see the start of a new, enduring European scientific research infrastructure, EBRAINS, hopefully on the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) roadmap. The SGA3 work plan builds on the strong scientific foundations laid in the preceding phases, makes structural adaptations to profit from lessons learned along the way (e.g. transforming the previous Subprojects and Co-Design Projects into fewer, stronger, well-integrated Work Packages) and introduces new participants, with additional capabilities. The SGA3 work plan is built around improved integration and a sharpening of focus, to ensure a strong HBP legacy at the end of this last SGA. In previous phases, the HBP laid the foundation for empowering empirical and theoretical neuroscience to approaching the different spatial and temporal scales using state-of-the-art neuroinformatics, simulation, neuromorphic computing, neurorobotics, as well as high-performance analytics and computing. While these disciplines have been evolving for some years, we now see a convergence in this field and a dramatic speeding-up of progress. Data is driving a scientific revolution that relies heavily on computing to analyse data and to provide the results to the research community. Only with strong computer support, is it possible to translate information into knowledge, into a deeper understanding of brain organisation and diseases, and into technological innovation. In this respect, the underlying Fenix HPC and data e-infrastructure, co-designed with the HBP, will be key.  The services offered by EBRAINS will be grouped in six Service Categories: SC1: Curated and shared data: EBRAINS FAIR data services - neuroscience data publishing SC2: Brain atlas services: navigate the brain in 3D - find, contribute and analyse brain data, based on location SC3: Brain modelling and simulation workflows: integrated tools to create and investigate models of the brain SC4: Closed loop AI and robotics workflows: design, test and implement robotic and AI solutions SC5: Medical Data Analytics SC6: Interactive workflows on HPC or NMC: Europe-wide access to scalable and interactive compute services Their users are to be supported with High-Level Support Teams and Vouchers, as well as Engagement and Facility Hubs located around Europe, at which additional services, unique equipment and compute infrastructure will be offered by local HBP Partners. Significant outcomes in relevant scientific communities are expected to materialise rapidly. Association with new Partnering Projects is still sought, along with wider international cooperation. The SGA3 objectives can be summarised as: 1)	Establish a sustainable European scientific research infrastructure, EBRAINS, leading to an increased use and adoption of FAIR data, web-based analyses, model building, simulation, atlasing, and virtual experiments for brain research and brain-inspired sciences. 2)	Provide a multi-level atlas of the human brain - the first of its kind that links microstructural detail and inter-subject variability. 3)	Increase the capacity of neuroscientists for multiscale neural activity modelling of the human brain network. 4)	Increase the availability of integrated multiscale data and computational models supporting brain states transitions, network complexity and cognitive functions. 5)	Enhance real-world task performance through biologically plausible adaptive cognitive architectures running on neuromorphic hardware and a closed-loop Neurorobotics Platform. 6)	Ensure that neuroscientific insights at the interface of neuro-inspired computing and technology are being translated into a benefit for patients with brain diseases. 7)	Ensure an ethically and legally compliant infrastructure and promote embedding of Responsible Research and Innovation, a

Against a pandemic crisis, the immediate identification of effective treatments have a paramount importance. First, E4C will select through the EXSCALATE platform, the most promising commercialized and developing drugs safe in man. Second, select from >500 billion molecules new pan coronavirus inhibitors. The huge computational resource, therefore the activities will be supported and empowered by three of the most powerful computer centers in Europe: CINECA, BSC and JÜLICH. The Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB) will provide the homology 3D models for the viral proteins. The Fraunhofer IME will provide the BROAD Repurposing Library and biochemical assays. Phenotypic screenings will be run by KU LUEVEN to identify molecules capable of blocking virus replication in in vitro models. IIMCB and ELECTRA will determine the crystal structure of at least one coronavirus functional proteins to evaluate the structural similarities with other viral proteins.

This PRISAR project provided a career-enabling human resource plethora of inter-disciplinary and inter-sectoral secondments, which resulted in the development, of not only a hybrid probe for image-guided surgery, but also a variety of tools and instruments. We now propose a new project, PRISAR2, to implement the next logical phase of this work, which is to clinically translate new and innovative monitoring technologies from industry. This will provide better patient selection and increase the surveillance window to allow for better treatment options over time and avoid surgery. This will involve developing new ‘watch and wait’ strategies to study the behaviour of the cancer so that any risks can be minimized. This would lead to a better clinical outcome and quality of life (QOL) for the patient and maximize the benefits of an active monitoring policy for both the patient and the healthcare system. When a patient is discovered to have cancer, one of the primary goals is to have the tumour removed by surgery. Here, however, we aim to (a) develop new monitoring technologies from industry so that the surveillance window can be increased to allow for better treatment options over time and to avoid surgery, (b) develop new ‘watch and wait’ strategies in order to study the behaviour of the cancer so that any risks to the patient can be minimised leading to a better clinical outcome and (c) train a new generation of preclinical and clinical scientists to be able to implement this new concept as standard of care and to maximise the benefits of an active monitoring policy.

Most anticancer therapies block tumor growth but do not elicit a long-lasting effect, thus compromising BC patient survival. Novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of aggressive types of BC are urgently needed and oncolytic viruses (OVs) represent promising anticancer therapeutics that selectively replicate in and kill cancer cells.    The interactions between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME) influence therapeutic response and patient prognosis. Our hypothesis is that the oncolytic adenovirus dl922-947 might be an efficient direct anticancer agent and might modulate TME as well. The interaction of OVs with TME is unexplored and needs to be elucidated to unveil the efficacy of virotherapy. OVs could represent good candidates for BC treatment, especially for resistant tumor or patients with poor prognosis.   The aim of this proposal is to investigate in vitro the direct oncolytic activity of dl922-947 and its ability to modulate the bidirectional crosstalk between BC cells and TME, particularly with two main components, adipocytes and macrophages. Moreover, dl922-947 activity will be also evaluated in ex vivo model of BC, such as patient derived tumor organoids (PDTOs).   We have preliminary data indicating that dl922-947 reduces cell viability in MCF7 and MDA-MB231 cells. We will now assess whether dl922-947 replicates in these cells and has similar effects in MCF7 tamoxifen-resistant cells. Moreover, we will characterize cell death mechanisms, cytokine/chemokine secretion in dl922-947-infected BC cells. Furthermore, the effect of dl922-947 in the crosstalk between BC cells and adipocytes and/or macrophages will be evaluated by co-culture models to assess BC cell proliferation and migration, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, cytokine/adipokine release and macrophage phenotype. We will finally verify in PDTOs the oncolytic activity of dl922-947 The expected outcomes of this proposal will lead to a complete evaluation of the efficacy of dl922-947 as anti-cancer agent in highly aggressive and drug resistant forms of breast cancer. dl922-947 is expected to induce cell death, reduce cytokine secretion in BC cells (as suggested by my preliminary data) and in BC-TME cell crosstalk. Furthermore, it will likely decrease BC cell migration and switch macrophages towards an anti-tumor phenotype. We expect to validate its efficacy in patient-derived cells. The study of OVs effects in BC microenvironment could unveil its therapeutic efficacy providing a complete evaluation of BC-TME crosstalk. Indeed, it could reveal unknown mechanisms responsible for acquisition of drug resistance, and help to predict therapy response. Moreover, ex vivo evaluation of oncolytic activity offers the possibility to stratify patients that can take advantage of the treatment with dl922-947.

The complementary research skills and training expertise within this inter-sectoral Network will ensure that the ESRs trained will be at the front of Europe’s next generation of innovative research leaders. The research topics revolve around the role, and potential, of metals in anaerobic biotechnologies for (i) metal recovery, (ii) bioremediation of waste streams containing high metal content or (iii) low metal content for biological applications. Thus, the focus of the research is on topics extended from the field of anaerobic bioprocesses. High-end analytical techniques and novel experimental approaches will be tested, and used, to provide training and an exceptional research environment in tackling the chemical, microbiological and biotechnological aspects of managing the ‘Metal Bioeconomy’. These areas will be explored along with modelling of the distribution and interactions of metals at the scale of elemental speciation (the ‘chemosphere’); cells and genomes (the ‘micro-scale’ and the “T-Elementome”); biofilms (at the scale of microbial communities and assemblages); and in anaerobic biotechnologies (the ‘technosphere’). Engaging projects have also been designed for the M2EX ESRs to investigate the fate, the role and the impact of metals on environmental quality and processes, to  understand the potential of the circular bioeconomy.

At the present time, manufacturers need drastically reduce the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions without sacrificing any safety or comfort. Each vehicle element must be considered for weight reduction. In this regard, gear transmissions are a first choice candidate. They form a reliable, versatile, and efficient way to transfer power while representing a significant fraction of the vehicle’s mass. LIVE-I project main objective is to achieve breakthrough technological progress in the design of lightweight gear transmission and to build an innovative training network in order to educate early stage researchers in this hot topic. The technical objective of LIVE-I project is to demonstrate a significant weight reduction of transmission using advanced modeling tools and digital twins together with advanced materials and systems. This objective will be pursued along different ways, each starting with mass reduction and exploring ways to achieve compromises between weight, efficiency, noise and vibration impacts. The modeling will cope with physical complexities of the problem, connected to non-linearities, multi-scale character among others. The weight/NVH (Noise, Vibration, Harshness) and efficiency improvements of gear transmissions will be tackled by introducing new paradigms in the design of housing and components, using new meta-materials and meta-structures, studying the robustness of a given optimization with respect to real manufacturing conditions, developing smart concepts. Numerical simulations and experiments will be carried out to validate the solutions. In addition to the described technical approaches a tight integration of the individual ESRs into the overall research program is taken care of and a specific training plan devoted to their up to date education in gearboxes design and optimization is offered.

Thus, deciphering the glycome holds huge promise to provide new targets and diagnostics for human health.   Despite the tremendous advance of knowledge in the field of Glycoscience during the last decade, the comprehension at high resolution of the molecular basis of many pathogen-mediated diseases is still incomplete.  GLYCOSWITCH will significantly contribute to fill this gap, providing a holistic picture of the manifold mechanisms of host responses to microbial infections, with a special focus on Gram-negative bacteria. I propose to address bacterial glycans recognition by host immune proteins by using a multidisciplinary approach, combining state-of-the-art synthetic organic chemistry, molecular biology, biochemistry and biophysics techniques, massively including NMR spectroscopy. I will apply them in an innovative integrated chemical biology approach in order to decipher key glycan recognition aspects beyond current knowledge. Understanding of molecular mechanisms of detection of invasive virulent bacteria by host organisms will allow to reach the ultimate goal of GLYCOSWITCH project: the design and development of novel and effective glycomimetics able to modulate the function of host immune receptor proteins.   The success of GLYCOSWITCH will unlock attractive opportunities for the development of host-directed strategies to boost the immune response or reverse pathogen-induced immunosuppression.  My unique approach to this project, as an organic chemist with wide expertise in NMR and bacterial glycans, will provide groundbreaking information on protein-glycan interaction systems of paramount importance in biology and biomedicine, opening new avenues for approaching bacterial diseases and their secondary effects.

Currently there is an established picture of the astrophysical scenario but only limited availability of reliable experimental data, with several key ingredients under dispute. SHADES will perform a direct measurement of the reaction to resolve the main open questions. The goal is to decrease the uncertainty in the astrophysical reaction rate in the relevant temperature range by at least one order of magnitude, providing a significant leap ahead from the state of the art. SHADES will deliver an increase in sensitivity of more than two orders of magnitude over the state of the art. We will gather direct experimental data over the entire astrophysically relevant energy range. We will construct a neutron detector specifically designed for this measurement. Beam-induced background, a severe problem in the past, will be discriminated by measuring the neutron energy while still maintaining a very detection high efficiency. In recent years research on capture-gated techniques and combinations of different detector types to measure neutron energies has increased greatly. The novel detector array will perfectly fit this profile and find a large field of applications also outside of nuclear astrophysics. The main measurements will be done with the new accelerator LUNA MV, allowing long-term high-intensity, high-energy resolution alpha bombardments. An extended, recirculating gas target will guarantee target stability under intense ion beams. The location of the experiment deep underground will drastically reduce the external background, the main limiting factor so far for low-energy measurements. In my team there will be also leading experts in the field to update the current stellar models using the new dataset to provide a greatly improved and much more robust picture of this important branch of stellar nucleosynthesis.

AMPERE will support decision making actors (e.g. institutions and public/ private companies in charge to manage electrical network) to collect all needed info to plan electrical network maintenance and upgrade.  In particular, the need for such a solution comes in emerging countries (worldwide) where, despite global electrification rates are significantly progressing, the access to electricity is still far from being achieved in a reliable way. Indeed, the challenge facing such communities goes beyond the lack of infrastructure assets: what is needed is a mapping of already deployed infrastructure (not known!) in order to perform holistic assessment of the energy demand and its expected growth over time.   In such a context, Galileo is a key enabler -especially, considering its free-of-charge High Accuracy Service (HAS) and its highly precise E5 AltBOC code measurements- as a core component to map electric utilities, optimise decision making process about the network development and therefore increase time and cost efficiency, offering more convenient way to manage energy distribution.  These aspects confer to the AMPERE project a worldwide dimension, having European industry the clear role to bring innovation and know-how to allow network intervention planning with a limited afforded financial risk above all for emerging non-European countries.

Objective of FoodE is to accelerate the growth of citizen-led City/Region food systems (CRFS) by bringing local initiatives across Europe together, as well as co-developing and disseminating a range of tools - co-designed with academia, citizens, and food system start-ups - to ensure that the most up-to-date cross-sectorial knowledge is applied. Start-ups will also provide an in-depth understanding of the needs of the key stakeholders, making resilient citizen-driven food systems happen. The key challenge is then to aggregate the most sustainable models of CRFS and enable co-creation of innovative pilot experiences, fostering the health and wellbeing of European citizens. This challenge will be tackled by setting a co-created mechanism, based on Citizen Science and Responsible Research and Innovation principles, where public authorities, citizens, business actors and non-profit organisations share ideas, tools, best practices and new models, supporting cities in becoming innovative food hubs. The outputs of FoodE will impact on job creation, promotion of local economy, strengthening the role of local communities in complying with Sustainable Development Goals, as well as identifying and strengthening relations between the different actors of the food chain. The way used by FoodE to achieve this goals consists of the following steps: - Define an operational methodology for the assessment of CRFS.  - Promote cross-pollination between European CRFS. - Contribute to increase access to affordable, safe and nutritious food. - Create a tool mobilising CRFS stakeholders in sustainability assessment. - Upscale the output to other EU cities.

For it there are few approved targeted therapies. Several studies indicate that the aberrant activation of the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway and the loss or reduced levels of the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) is common in TNBC and affects the expression of genes controlling immune signaling. Particularly, the activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway is associated with BC metastasis and poor prognosis. It has been demonstrated that targeting the inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 signaling impairs tumor growth and metastasis, also in TNBC. SOCS3 protein demonstrated a regulator of the inflammatory response of cytokines in many tumors in particular its over-expression demonstrated a onco-suppressor role in TNBC. Thus, the development of compounds mimicking the action of SOCS3 protein represents a useful strategy for the treatment of aggressive/metastatic TNBC. On this basis, the principal aim of the present project is to identify SOCS3's mimetics as potential and novel therapeutics in suppressing the inflammatory cytokine production in aggressive TNBC.    Phase I: On the basis of available structural data on the complex gp130-JAK2-SOCS, compounds mimicking SOCS3 interfaces will be designed in order to include hot spots of interaction in the correct conformation for the binding to JAK2. Structural and functional in vitro binding assays will be performed to test the ability of compounds to bind to JAK2 (by direct binding assays) and to mimic the action of SOCS3 (through competition binding assays) in order to obtain kinetic (SPR, Surface Plasmon Resonance) and thermodynamic (ITC, Isothermal Titration Calorimetry and MST, Microscale Thermophoresis) features of the investigated complexes. SAR studies including structural investigations (CD, Circular Dichroism, and fluorescence) will speed lead compounds prioritization Phase II: 2-3 peptidomimetics will be selected and further optimized in a process of conversion of peptides in compounds with enhanced drug-like features.  This selection will be carried out by in vitro biochemical screening of inhibitors following iterative optimization cycles. These experiments will alternate with re-synthesis cycles of the most active compounds optimizing them in terms of: i) inhibition of JAK2/SOCS3 complex; ii) water solubility; iii) reduced size, flexibility and protease's susceptibility. Phase III: The most active compounds from phase I and II will be tested in cellular and in vivo assays. Particularly, cell culture assays in models of 4T1 murine breast tumour and MDA-MB-231 cell lines and in vivo in 4T1 tumour bearing BALB/mice will be carried out. Expected results are related to the identification of novel potential therapeutics in TNBC capable to reduce both primary tumor growth and metastasis. Their structural and functional characterization will provide insights in their mechanism of action and will pave the way for new and selective therapy in unresponsive cancers with activated inflammatory cytokines. TNBC is a subtype of breast cancer in which no therapies except chemo and radio are known. This project could impact on new therapeutic ways to treat this aggressive pathology.

G4s have been shown to be strongly associated with cancer development and progression. G4s stabilization by specific ligands leads to transcriptional repression of oncogenes or to the activation of DNA damage response at telomere, inducing tumor cell death. In vivo activity of G4-ligands has been reported, thus validating G4-targeting by small organic molecules as an emerging therapeutic approach in oncology. However, most of the bioactive G4-binders reported so far share unfavorable chemical properties, which resulted in poor pharmacokinetics and low selectivity, leading to severe toxicities. The identification of new drug-like chemical entities overcoming such drawbacks and able to modulate telomere maintenance, gene expression and induce tumor cell death with low toxicity could further promote the G4-binders as new anticancer therapeutics. The basic idea is to create libraries of new molecular scaffolds exploiting the chemical nature of nucleobases, which are intrinsically able to accept and donate hydrogen bonds and to make very efficient π-stacking interactions with the target nucleic acids. This project aims to the discovery of potent and drug-like G4-binders through the use of advanced synthetic methodologies allowing a fast and easy search for more stable and less toxic compounds, exhibiting increased solubility and bioavailability, and improved binding affinity. The identification of such compounds will also provide new information about the different telomeric and promoter-G4 tridimensional structures and their biological functions, lending new rational basis for the design of potent selective G4-binders. In order to identify such new scaffolds, the unprecedented application of Multi-Component Reactions (MCRs) to the search for potent G4-binders is herein proposed. MCRs, indeed, will produce focused libraries of different scaffolds, which will be inspired by the use of nucleobases or their analogues as starting materials, in order to exploit their innate affinity towards nucleic acids. The binding properties of the synthesized compounds will be evaluated by means of both biophysical and biological assays, which will drive further cycles of optimization of both activity and selectivity. The innovative use of nucleobases and related compounds in MCRs will provide a bio-inspired synthesis of new scaffolds, which would intrinsically share good affinities for peculiar grooves and loops of different G4-architectures. This strategy will provide, in a fast and cheap manner, new drug candidates able to induce tumor cell death through the stabilization of G4s, and will result in a rational, practical and usable approach, and in ready-to-go products. The inhibition of oncogene expression and the targeting of telomeres are promising new strategies to kill tumor cells. A number of oncogenes are clinically validated targets, yet several of the proteins encoded by these genes are considered to be undruggable. In these cases, targeting of gene expression rather than its products could be a successful strategy. Also, ligands of telomeric-G4s could be characterized by both a low toxicity and a broad clinical activity. The identification of potent and selective drugs is pivotal to validate this approach and provide new therapeutic anticancer agents.

However, only a small fraction of mCRC patients are responsive to EGFR inhibition and the vast majority of those who initially benefit from such targeted therapy develop resistance. Despite it is well established that RAS mutations correlate with resistance to anti-EGFR mAbs, little is known on the mechanisms by which EGFR activity is disabled in resistant cells. To date, very limited therapeutic options are available for patients who display resistance to EGFR blockade. We have robust preliminary data that suggest the involvement of p21-activated kinases (PAKs) in sustaining resistance to anti-EGFR mAbs in CRC cells. We hypothesize that PAK signaling could act as alternative escape pathway in condition of constitutive RAS dependent and acquired RAS independent resistance against EGFR inhibition. Pharmacological inhibition of PAKs signaling could represent a novel and effective treatment option for anti-EGFR resistant mCRC patients.  Our aims are: a) to elucidate how PAKs signaling pathway affects CRC growth in relationship to RAS mutations b) to finely dissect the mechanistic connection between PAKs and EGFR activation  c) to study the contribution of PAKs dependent signaling activation to constitutive and acquired resistance against anti-EGFR mAbs; d) to test novel therapeutic strategies for resistant CRC cells; e) to define a ""PAK-signature"" as biomarker predictive of sensitivity to anti-EGFR mAbs.  The research project is focused on human CRC. We will take advantage from the availability of in vitro and in vivo models of constitutive, RAS dependent, and acquired, RAS independent, EGFR-mAbs resistance. The contribution of PAK signaling pathways to EGFR activation will be deeply investigated. We will use biochemical, molecular biology, transcriptome sequencing, histochemical and molecular pathology techniques. We will conduct studies in vitro and in vivo, in cell lines and patients derived xenografts (PDXs), either sensitive or resistant to anti-EGFR mAbs, assessing the efficacy of novel drug combinations based on the inhibition of the PAK/BetaCatenin signaling axis. The preclinical studies will be integrated with a translational study aimed to assess the predictive relevance of a PAK-signature in tumor tissues samples derived from CRC patients treated anti-EGFR mAbs.  We expect: a) to provide new mechanistic insights regarding PAKs-dependent EGFR activation; b) to elucidate the role of PAKs as key signaling pathways able to circumvent EGFR blockade; c) to demonstrate the effectiveness of PAK/BetaCatenin inhibition in CRC cells resistant to anti-EGFR mAbs; d) to preliminarily validate a novel PAK-signature as predictive biomarker to be used in mCRC patients to be treated with anti-EGFR mAbs. The results of our research project should provide useful and critical information with potentially strong implications on cancer treatment. We aim to clarify the role of PAKs activation in sustaining CRC growth and resistance to anti-EGFR mAbs, thus proposing novel therapeutic strategies to be transferred to patients unresponsive to EGFR pharmacological blockade and identifying predictive biomarkers to help the selection of patients for molecularly targeted treatment."

TH deregulation is frequent in human tumors, but its role in driving or controlling cancer growth in vivo is still poorly understood. An emerging concept is that TH actions can be tailored in a time- and cell-specific manner by the deiodinase enzymes that can increase (D2) or decrease (D3) the active TH concentration regardless of plasma levels. Recent publications and novel preliminary data from our group demonstrated that D2 and D3 are dynamically regulated in basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of human and mouse origin.  The complexity of TH action in regulating multiple aspects of cell biology poses significant hurdles in evaluating the potency in controlling multiple aspects of tumorigenesis, ranging from cancer formation to progression and metastatic transformation. This proposal will investigate as yet unrevealed functions of the local control of thyroid status by D2 and D3 in non-melanoma skin cancer  (NMSC). Our working hypothesis is that the coordinated action of deiodinases, by modulating local TH action, controls tumor formation by affecting the homeostasis of skin cancer stem cells, and tumor progression by regulating the progression to invasive phenotypes. We will dissect the role of TH signaling in skin cancer stem cells (CSCs) and in NMSC tumorigenesis. In Specific Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that TH inactivation by D3 is a critical feature of early steps of tumorigenesis by reducing the amplification of CSCs and thus in turn reducing tumor growth. In Specific Aim 2 we will explore the potential of TH amplification to induce invasiveness in NMSC.  The impact of TH on CSCs will be evaluated by using genetically manipulated mouse lines and primary cultures of CSCs. Basal cell carcinoma will be induced in available K14CREER;SmoM2;D3Fl/Fl (SmoM2-D3KO) mice, and we will study histological and molecular changes in cell proliferation, survival and tumor growth. CSCs will be isolated by FACS sorting in SmoM2-D3KO mice and compared to SmoM2 mice for their stemness and amplification potential. A causal link in humans between TH signal alteration and skin neoplastic transformation will be investigated by analyzing skin lesions from three patients with mutations in the TRα gene and affected by mental retardation and hypothyroidism at tissue level. To address the role of TH in tumor progression, chemically induced SCC models and UV-irradiation studies will be applied to D2- and D3-depleted mice to determine the spatio-temporal consequences of TH modulation on tumor progression and invasiveness. Dissecting the function of TH in skin tumors will reveal the mechanisms underlying  hormonal control of cancer growth. This work will also set the stage for the use of hormonal regulation as a tool with which to manipulate at will the homeostasis of cancer stem cells, and thus to modulate their expansion and differentiation in a therapeutic context. The functional role of TH in the landscape of tumorigenesis is likely to have broad implications in terms of interfering with the multiple steps of cancer formation.

Antiestrogen (endocrine) therapies, including selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs; i.e., tamoxifen), selective ER down-regulators (SERDs; i.e., fulvestrant) and aromatase inhibitors, are widely used for the treatment of ER+ breast cancer. To date, the only mechanisms of resistance that have been shown in the clinic are HER2 gene amplification and mutations in the ligand binding domain (LBD) of ERα. More recently, the small molecules CDK4/6 inhibitors have been approved in combination with endocrine therapy for the treatment of metastatic ER+ breast cancer. As for other cancer targeted therapies, however, acquired resistance to this combination occurs. We identified FGFR1 as possible mechanism of resistance to the treatment of fulvestrant combined with a CDK4/6 inhibitor using a kinase open reading frames (ORFs) screening in ER+ MCF7 human breast cancer cells. Based on our preliminary results we hypothesize that targeting FGFR1 in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors and endocrine therapy may provide a novel treatment strategy for patients with ER+ breast cancer. Our aims are: AIM1: To investigate the role of FGFR1 in driving resistance to the combination of CDK4/6 inhibitors and endocrine therapy in ER+/HER2-/FGFR1-amplified breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs).  AIM2: To study the cell cycle progression and the role of quiescence vs senescence in ER+/HER2-/FGFR1-amplified breast cancer cells. AIM3: To model clinical resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitor and antiestrogen therapy using ex vivo tumor organoids To achieve our goals, we will treat athymic mice engrafted with ER+/HER2-/FGFR1-amplified PDXs with either vehicle, fulvestrant plus palbociclib, erdafitinib (an FGFR1 inhibitor), or the combination of the three drugs. At different treatment time-points, tumors will be harvested and mechanically/enzymatically dissociated to the single-cell level. Then, transcriptional profiling will be performed to identify correlative expression patterns in proliferating (high Ki67) cancer cells compared with non-proliferating (low Ki67) breast cancer cells under treatment. Moreover, we will perform in vitro studies to understand the role of FGFR1 in cell cycle progression and cellular senescence. Finally, we will use three-dimensional (3D) organotypic cultures as a platform for discovery of mechanisms of drug resistance and for validation testing of therapeutic strategies to overcome CDK4/6 inhibitor resistance. We expect to identify a sub-population of Ki67+ resistant cells in PDXs and/or in organoids derived from patients biopsies treated with each inhibitor alone or in combination. Consistent with our preliminary data, we expect resistant subpopulations will have higher FGFR1 expression. Thus, this analysis may identify an ER/FGFR1 regulated gene signature associated with the resistant phenotype, allowing us to design novel therapeutic targets. These studies will shed light on new mechanisms of resistance to the combination treatment of endocrine therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitors and will offer the rationale for further translational and clinical investigation of novel combinations therapies in ER+ breast cancer.

High-risk NB patients have a 5-year survival rate < 50% although receiving intensive therapy. Modernized approaches call for choosing therapeutics are based on the underlying mutations in each individual patient's tumor providing rational use of molecular-guided therapies. The spectrum of somatic mutation of the most aggressive forms of NB is not completely determined. Much is known about the function and clinical impact of recurrent ""hotspot"" mutations in genes including ALK, ATRX, and TERT rearrangements. However, high-throughput sequencing-based studies have shown that the mutational burden increases at relapse and the clonally acquired somatic mutations offer clinically tractable targets currently studied in prospective trials. As most studies rely heavily on targeted exome sequencing, the understanding of somatic variations in noncoding regions has improved substantially. Previously genoma-wide association studies (GWASs) using DNA from non-disease cells (usually blood) have revealed that many loci that are associated with cancer susceptibility (including NB) lie in non-coding regions of the genome. However the non-protein-coding cancer genome remains widely unexplored in cancer development.  The relative paucity of somatic mutations limits the possibility to define genes with high significance in NB. Since the majority of somatic variants occur in non-coding portions of the genome, we speculate that a large-scale sequencing as whole-genome-sequencing (WGS) of primary tumors (at diagnosis) and relapsed neuroblastoma integrated with clinical data and computational modeling might unravel novel cancer driver mutations responsible of development and progression of this devastating disease. The main aim of this project is to identify and functionally characterize the nonconding cancer mutations in primary and relapsed NB. We plan to test our central hypothesis by the achievements of the following milestones: 1) Identification of non-coding variants in primary and relapsed NB by whole genome sequencing 2) Functionally validation of the non-coding driver mutations by genome editing in vitro 3) Identification of ""actionable mutations"" in NB. 4) Determine the effects of the selected ""actionable mutations"" in vivo by proof of concept animal model.   We expect to obtain a large spectrum of gene mutations involved in resistance and relapse that will allow an earlier identification of non-responders to treatment and may orient a personalized therapy. Our finding raises a new challenge in the treatment of cancer that involves the use of a selection of therapies based on different genetic alterations in individual tumors. Clearly, the accomplishment of key driver noncoding mutations will help to establish a next-generation sequencing-based driven trial in NB to define the precise subset of acquired somatic changes in real-time in relapsed tumors thereby creating an opportunity to offer therapies targeting the specific pathways."

The Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) receptor and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, are immune checkpoint (IC) effectors critical for self-tolerance. Cancer cells upregulate these effectors to escape the immune system attack. Indeed, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are the current breakthrough in cancer therapy. Patients with poorly differentiated (PDTC) and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATC), have no effective cure and high rate of mortality. Systematic studies analyzing the regulation, function and possible therapeutic targeting of IC in aggressive thyroid carcinoma (TC) are lacking. We have recently found that interleukin-8 (IL-8), by binding CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptors, sustains stem cell features of TC cells. Since immunosuppressive activity often associates with stemness, we asked whether IL-8 could contribute to immunotolerance in TC. We found that TC cells constitutively express PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2. Moreover, IL-8 substantially increased, and reparixin, an IL-8 receptor inhibitor, decreased protein levels of ICs. Chemotherapy and targeted therapy currently used in ATC substantially increased IC levels, and this could be inhibited by reparixin. We also found that the PD-1 intrinsic circuit contributes to the proliferative activity of TC cells by activating the RAS/BRAF/ERK pathway. Thus, the inhibition of the PD-1 circuit hampers TC cell growth and immunosuppressive abilities. Here, we propose to dissect the molecular mechanisms of IL-8-mediated IC modulation in TC and to exploit this IL-8 function to develop novel combinatorial therapies for aggressive TC. IL-8 controls various functions of TC cells, including the expression/function of the PD-1 circuit. PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 exert cell autonomous functions in TC cells, but also promote  immunosuppression in tumor microenvironment. Understanding the mechanisms of IL-8/PD-1 circuitry will be critical to develop novel rational therapies for aggressive TC.    WP1: Dissecting the mechanisms underlying IL-8-mediated immune checkpoint regulation;  WP2: Defining the cell autonomous and non cell autonomous functions of immune checkpoints in TC;  WP3: Developing rational therapeutic strategies for aggressive TC  WP1: PD-L1 stability will be assessed by protein synthesis and degradation assays; molecular determinants of PD-L1 stability will be searched by siRNA library screening; IHC analysis on TC samples will define prognostic power of ICs  WP2: PD-1 circuit role in TC will be evaluated by using cell signaling analysis in cell cultures and tumor forming efficiency in immunocompromised and in immunocompetent mice models. WP3: Immunogenic cell death evaluation will be assessed by ER-stress markers, IFN I and ATP secretion, HMGB1 translocation, phagocytosis assays; syngeneic models of TC will be used to test therapeutic efficacy and immunogenicity of different drug combinations.   1. Providing mechanistic insights into IL-8/PD-1 circuits in TC; 2. Developing novel therapeutic schemes involving the IL-8/PD-1 circuits for aggressive TC. Poorly differentiated (PDTC) and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATC) display radioiodine resistant, recurrent and/or metastatic behaviour, for which novel therapies are needed. Since IL-8 sustains critical properties of aggressive TC, including immunosuppression, we believe that dissecting the molecular basis of this activity will be critical for the development of novel therapeutic combinations active in aggressive TC.

GBM is the most frequent and aggressive form of primary brain tumor in the adult population. The high recurrence rate and resistance of GBM cells to drugs urgently demands a better molecular-tailored therapy for this disease. We wish to provide proof of-principle studies that inhibiting the key elements of this molecular network may have therapeutic effects on GBM. Our work focuses on the role of PKA-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) in the regulation of compartmentalized cAMP•PKA signaling. AKAPs function as molecular relays that generate spatial and temporal codes of cAMP signals, ensuring efficient propagation of signals to target sites. Recently, we have discovered a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase (praja2) that acts as an AKAP that binds and targets PKA holoenzyme to the cell membrane, perinuclear region and cellular organelles. By regulating cAMP signaling, praja2 efficiently couples phosphorylation to ubiquitination of protein kinases, scaffolds and effectors, with important implication for differentiation and cell proliferation. We have demonstrated that dysregulation of praja2-regulated signaling pathways has been causally linked to GBM growth and progression. The discovery of novel praja2 targets connecting cAMP•PKA to UPS in GBM cells would likely contribute to a successful GBM treatment.  We have identified novel praja2-UPS substrates involved in signaling, metabolism and autophagy in GBM cells. We envisage the existence of a more robust and global ubiquitin ligase•kinase network regulated by praja2 that acts in response to metabolic and growth signals to control tumor cell growth. We wish to identify the key players in this network and selectively target these proteins to inhibit GBM growth.   AIM1. Expression analysis and role of praja2 in human glioblastoma.  AIM2. The E3-ligase praja2 regulates energy metabolism and growth of GBM cells.  AIM3. Inhibition of GBM growth by selective targeting of cAMP-regulated praja2 targets.    AIM 1. We wish to analyze the levels of praja2 in an wide number of glioma samples, comparing its levels to hystologic subtypes, different recurrence rate and metastatic potential of tumor lesions, and probe praja2 function in GBM growth.  AIM2. We have discovered novel praja2 partners/targets involved in different aspects of cancer cell metabolism. We wish to analyze the biological relevance of these interactions in terms of GBM growth and progression.  AIM3. We wish to inhibit GBM growth by targeting the praja2-regulated signaling network in the context of a growing tumor. Specifically, we will use orthotopic mouse models of GBM to interfere with praja2-UPS pathway and will evaluate the biological effects of such a manipulation on GBM growth. We expect to identify and validate novel substrates/regulators of the cAMP-UPS pathway that control metabolic pathways, autophagy and growth of GBM cells  The discovery of novel targets connecting cAMP•PKA to UPS will significantly expand our understanding of praja2-regulated cancer cell signalling, particularly metabolism and growth, hence laying foundations for therapeutic innovation that will improve treatment of GBM.

While coordination of mitotic events prevents aneuploidy, an abnormal chromosome set and a cancer cell hallmark, pharmacological interference with these events is exploited for cancer therapy. To ensure correct chromosome segregation, the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) delays the onset of anaphase, when sister chromatids separate, until spindle assembly completion by inhibiting degradation of securin, anaphase inhibitor, and cyclin B, activator of the major mitosis-promoting cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1). This safeguard mechanism is also a target for cancer therapy. Indeed, taxanes and vinca alkaloids, widely used anti-microtubule cancer drugs (AMCDs), hamper spindle assembly and induce a prolonged SAC-dependent mitotic delay that translates into apoptotic programme activation. Nevertheless, resistance and toxicity reduce their efficacy. Thus, further understanding of mitosis exit mechanisms would help to improve AMCDs therapeutic efficacy, to develop new therapeutic strategies and to better understand cancer pathogenesis. Recently, we identified a crucial for Fcp1, an essential phosphatase, in mitosis exit and unveiled the relevance for Fcp1-dependent control of Wee1, a Cdk1 inhibitory kinase, in cancer cell resistance to AMCDs. Consequently, we produced rationale for a new, advantageous, AMCDs/Wee1 inhibitor combination therapy, now clinically testable. In next five years we wish to further investigate mitosis exit mechanisms and, also based on our preliminary evidence (see Proposal Main Body), establish: 1. how Fcp1 is regulated at mitosis exit; 2. how Cdk1 activity and microtubule polymerization are coordinated for spindle assembly. 3. new anticancer combination therapies and drug targets. 1) An Fcp1-based relay for the Cdk1 activity cycle. 2) Coordination of microtubule polymerization and Cdk1 activity is essential for spindle assembly. 3) New therapeutic approaches targeting mitosis exit.

Aim2) Task1 Analysis of spindle assembly and molecular interactions upon genetic or chemical Plk1, Cdc6, Fcp1, Wee1, p21, Myt1 -dependent pathways manipulation and Task2 spindle assembly requirement for Cdk1 activity control (by coIps, IF, time-lapse video-microscopy). Aim3) Task1 Preclinical in vitro studies testing combination therapies (cell death, cell cycle determination etc. in various cancer cell lines). Task2 Exploiting new information on targets to device tests for small interfering molecules screening. Aim1) Mechanisms for Fcp1 control and new Fcp1 and Arpp19 substrates/interactors. Aim2) Establishment of requirement for coordination between Cdk1 activity and microtubule polymerization in spindle assembly. Aim3) Mechanistic rationale for new combination therapies and new drugable targets. More information on mitosis progression will provide rationale for new combination therapies and  help to identify new drug targets increasing our anticancer armoury.
100|grant.13059208|18695; 14802|Targeting DNA i-motif structures: a new frontier in anticancer therapy|Targeting DNA i-motif structures: a new frontier in anticancer therapy|Non-canonical DNA secondary structures can be formed by sequences that are widely distributed, but not randomly located, throughout the human genome and play crucial roles in a number of biological functions. Guanine-rich stretches of DNA can form unusual structures, called G-quadruplexes, known to play key roles in cancer. Wherever there is a G-quadruplex forming sequence in one strand, the complementary strand contains a cytosine-rich sequence that may be capable of forming another non-canonical structure, known as i-motif.  G-quadruplex/i-motif forming sequences are frequently located in or near the regulatory regions of numerous oncogenes and in the terminal regions of chromosomes, the telomeres, thus implying their involvement in a variety of cellular functions. There are evidences that small molecules able to bind i-motif structures can modulate gene expression and enhance telomerase inhibition. Despite the i-motif structures are now well-validated biological targets, very limited efforts have been carried out to date to develop ligands able to target them. A cutting-edge frontier in biomedicine is thus bringing i-motifs into focus as drug targets for the treatment of cancer. DNA i-motifs have distinctive structural features that make them unique compared to other DNA secondary structures. This can be strategic to design selective and thus low toxic ligands to be used in anticancer therapy. Therefore, this project aims at the discovery of new drug-like molecules specifically binding and promoting i-motif structures in human telomere and oncogene promoter regions. These molecules can act as antitumor agents by themselves, but they could also be used in synergy with G-quadruplex ligands.  The experimental design is divided in six tasks. Task 1 is dedicated to the search of i-motif forming sequences. Task 2 is focused on their biophysical study, both from the structural and energetic point of view. Task 3 is focused on the determination of their three-dimensional structure. These structures will be used as targets in virtual screening calculations (Task 4), which will identify potential ligands whose binding properties will be evaluated by biophysical methodologies (Task 5). Finally, the best molecules will be biologically tested on a panel of human cancer cell lines (Task 6).  We expect to find ligands able to selectively bind i-motif DNA structures and to exert anticancer activity. The discovered compounds will have drug-like scaffolds that could represent the staring point for the development of a new generation of molecules to be used in anticancer therapy. The chemical features of these ligands will be analyzed to determine the structural requisites that are essential for the selective binding of i-motif structures.  This research project aims at the discovery of anti-cancer candidate drugs specifically binding and stabilizing telomeric and oncogene promoter i-motif DNA under physiological conditions. The discovery of such molecules would be invaluable to the field of cancer biology. In addition, our studies will contribute to expand the current knowledge on the roles of i-motifs in cancer, with enormous potential repercussions.

DNA replication and DNA damage repair are strictly dependent on iron and many enzymes involved in these pathways are dependent on iron. Our preliminary data indicate that NCOA4 blocks DNA replication under low iron conditions and it is involved in restricting replication origin activation and in promoting ferritin degradation also upon DNA damage. In addition, NCOA4 is fused to RET gene in several human cancers as part of the NCOA4-RET oncogenic rearrangement. We observed that NCOA4-RET fusion protein acts as a dominant negative mutant blocking ferritinophagy promoted by NCOA4 wt protein. Our hypothesis is that NCOA4 is part of a signalling cascade that links iron cellular levels to control of DNA replication and response to DNA damage. Cancer cells may be addicted to such NCOA4 functions, and cancers carrying NCOA4-RET rearrangement may display synthetic lethality under iron unbalanced conditions. Aims of this proposal are to study: 1)	how iron regulates DNA replication via NCOA4  2)	the role of NCOA4-mediated functions (ferritinophagy and control of DNA replication) in response to DNA damage (DDR) 3)	the role of NCOA4 in neoplastic cells, in particular in those harbouring the NCOA4-RET rearrangement.  The three aims will be developed in 3 Tasks. We plan to: 1)	i) explore block of DNA replication in low iron by NCOA4, ii) investigate how NCOA4 protein stabilization promotes block of replication and iii) map DNA replication origin and NCOA4 binding sites on chromatin under normal and low iron conditions. 2)	i) explore NCOA4 protein stabilization and posttranslational modifications upon DNA damage, in particular secondary to DDR kinases, ii) study the role of NCOA4 mediated block of DNA replication and ferritinophagy in response to DDR, iii) analyse NCOA4 localization to chromatin and to stalled replication forks upon DDR activation. 3)	i) modulate genetically NCOA4 protein expression in different cancer cell lines to explore their dependency on NCOA4 function in normal and low/high iron conditions, ii) investigate the dominant negative effect of NCOA4-RET fusion protein in cells in vitro and in a conditional mouse model expressing NCOA4-RET in thyroid follicular cells.   We believe that the study of how iron levels influence DNA replication and repair via NCOA4 will help in depicting new key aspects of genomic stability maintenance, particularly in cancer.  Our prediction is that the iron-DNA replication network controlled by NCOA4 is relevant  in cancer cells. This research project will also explore how the presence of NCOA4-RET rearrangement in cancer cells can generate a specific vulnerability to iron deprivation that can be exploited for anti-neoplastic treatment.

We plan to identify which population of immune cells is active  in primary human MB group3-4 tissues [T cells; Tregs; microglia/tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs); Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells [MDSCs] and Dendritic Cells (DCs)].  These analyses will be further performed in our recently generated mouse metastatic model of MB group 3 [TG-MATH1-Prune1-p53 -/-] using both primary and spinal TME tissues. Then we will perform in-vitro studies to target the TME  using immunomodulatory actions of an anti-Prune-1 drug (AA7.1) and its synergistic effects with molecules recently identified. Further we will perform NGS-WES sequence analyses in human metastatic MB group 3-4 cohorts combined with our tumors generated in mice to identify new deleterious mutations (NSVs) as new metastatic gene drivers. These analyses altogether will be able to define how tumor evolution is regulated by immune system through Chip-SEQ approaches. A pre-clinical study in mice using immunomodulatory drugs in combination with the anti-Prune-1 molecule will be then performed. Finally, we will generate a novel prognostic kit containing  all the mutated gene list here identified able to predict metastatic MB using NGS-TGP methodology.  These results will provide evidences on the most prominent immune cell component in the brain TME of MB group3, thus identifying novel targets for new immunomodulatory approaches. Then, we will also dissect the immune escape mechanisms during the tumor evolution, thus identifying novel mutations responsible for the metastatic spread in MB group3-4. These findings will also have diagnostic and prognostic values to generate a ""pro-metastatic signature"" for metastatic MB group3-4.  Chemoradiation regimens for pediatric brain cancer treatments cause side effects. This research move forward to future clinical trials with combined targeted and immune modulatory therapies to fight metastatic posterior fossa tumors. Of great importance is the generation of a prognostic kit to role out the disease status and progression. We will generate new therapeutic weapons to fight metastases, the cause of poor prognosis."

G4-unwinding helicases counter telomere/gene modulation by G4s and are sensibly overexpressed in several cancers. The helicase role in cancer onset is complex and their inhibition tout-court is not a viable option. Besides, several G4-stabilizing small organic molecules inhibit tumor cells growth and, although there is information on the impact of G4-binders on helicase-G4 recognition/interaction, little is known on the interaction modes and energetics.  G4-ligands impact helicase activity through G4 stabilization and possibly by inducing G4 conformation changes. The G4-ligand-helicases interaction is a hot topic but still partially unexplored. Its thorough in vitro and in vivo characterization might improve the understanding of reciprocal influence each party has in the helicase-driven modulation of the G4s biological functions. This will provide directions for rationally upgrade current anticancer G4-targeting candidate drugs.  This project aims to investigate different cancer-relevant, G4-forming DNA sequences; to study the energetics of molecular interactions and dynamical behavior of G4s with known and new anticancer drug candidates, which can significantly interfere with several biological processes involving G4s; to gain information on the G4:helicase and G4:drug:helicase interaction in-vitro and in-cell by complementary physicochemical and biochemical methodologies. The research activities will develop in three tasks.  Task 1. Study of G4:drug interaction using both known and potential anticancer-active drugs, aimed to discover new potential anticancer drugs. G-quadruplex-forming DNA sequences from human oncogene promoters and telomeres will be targeted. Task 2. In-vitro analysis of the effect of the drugs on the interactions with cancer-relevant human helicases. Task 3. Effect of DNA helicase deficiency on the cancer cell sensitivity to G4-binders.   1) In vitro studies will provide the affinity and the energetics of G4:ligand, G4:helicase, and G4:drug:helicase interactions. Different interaction modes are expected as dependent on the ligand, the G4 (from either human oncogene promoters or telomeres), and different helicases, helicase constructs and mutants, to unravel mutual influences between the triad components and their effects on the molecular recognition and G4-unwinding activity.  2) Understanding how the drugs may affect G4 stability, dynamics and processing within the cells. 3) Multiple in-cell assays will clarify the sensitivity of various cell lines (HeLa, U2OS, HEK 293T) to the G4-ligands in terms of proliferation, DNA double-strand and DNA repair response, metaphase chromosomes integrity, chromosome fusion events, anaphase bridges after DAPI-staining, telomeres fragility. Helicases-defective cells and/or transfected with non-functional mutant helicases will provide information on the ligand effects in the absence of helicase activity.   Understanding the driving biophysical and biochemical forces, as well as how G4-ligands interfere with the G4-helicase recognition, is a key point for upgrading the current generation of G4-ligands. The joint expertise will address research towards the rational design of anticancer-active molecules that account also for helicases, not limiting to the mere G4-ligand couple.

A range of mechanisms appear to be involved where autophagy can impact DNA damage repair. These initial findings have attracted particular attention in the context of malignancy; however key questions remain that need to be addressed to move this area of research forward and illuminate the overall consequence of targeting this process in human therapies. Our preliminary findings suggest the existence of other, as yet undefined mechanisms though which autophagy controls DNA damage repair pathways.   Aim 1. Analyze how autophagy influences DSB repair pathways  Aim 2. Identify the DNA damage-driven specific TFEB/TFE3 transcription program Aim 3. Assess the clinical relevance of autophagy in resistance to therapy We propose to: Aim 1: analyze how autophagy influences DSB repair pathways by using a cellular system that provides a unique opportunity to simultaneously study, at a molecular level, the repair events that transpire at many different DSBs located within various chromatin states; Aim 2: define the DNA damage-driven specific TFEB/TFE3 transcription program, through omics approaches. Aim 3: assess the clinical relevance of autophagy in resistance to therapy by in vivo tumor phenotyping experiments, along with bioinformatics approaches for the identification of effectors candidates and biomarkers.  We expect to: (1) understand how autophagy regulates DNA repair proficiency and pathway choice throughout the cell cycle and the molecular events underlying these regulatory mechanisms; (2) characterize in details the role of TFEB/TFE3 in DNA damage response; (3) generate instrumental information on  The identification of specific tumor types and biomarkers that facilitate our understanding and rationale to either inhibit or activate autophagy as a therapeutic strategy in cancer is of great interest and is expected to produce novel, practical outputs of future benefit to patients with difficult-to-treat malignancies.

Several studies in humans across multiple cancers have conclusively shown that the presence of tumor- infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is often associated with favorable prognosis. We can imagine three main dimensions that influence the immune response to cancer. The first  is defined by the genetics of the tumor. The second consists of the genetic make-up of the subject, and the third  is represented by environmental factors. Somatic mutations, copy number aberrations, or epigenetic changes define the 'genetics of the tumor' dimension, while microbiome, virome or lifestyle habits, such as smoking or alcohol consumption, delineate the 'environment' component. These dimensions can modulate each other. The simultaneous evaluation of all these components represents a systematic approach but poses several challenges, especially from a computational point of view, since it requires the synchronous collection of a wide diversity of samples and extensive clinical, phenotypic, and demographic data that are not easily integrated.  - Perform a comprehensive immune landscape of glioma - Single-cell dissection of the GBM microenvironment  - Identification of the  regulatory landscape of glioma at single cells level and detection of pro-inflammatory  and immune-suppressive Master Regulators  - Experimental Characterization of  Master Regulators of subpopulations  of Tumor cells  and Myeloid cells - ICR characterization of the TCGA dataset and characterization of ICR groups in the TCGA pan-glioma cohort -  Immunogenity  prediction by a neonatigen fitness model  - Integration of neoantigen prediction with immune cell types and their correlation with clinical information  - Identification of homogenous cell subpopulations in tumor microenvironment  - Identification of homogeneous cell subpopulation in transformed cells  - Identification of glioma stemness markers by joint analysis of primary tumors and glioma spheres at single cell level    - Identification of the master regulators of immune cells subpopulations  - Identification of the  master regulators of transformed cells  - Experimental characterization of MR of transformed cells - Experimental characterization of MR of myeloid cells    This project aims to address  the following research questions: - Are the GBM characterized by different immune phenotypes as in the three-classes cancer-immune paradigm? - Which are the specific molecular features characterized by different immune phenotype in GBM? - Which are the transcriptional programs, as single cell resolution, activated in the GBM microenvironment? - How to identify key Master Regulators of the cells of the microenvironment that can be manipulated through overexpression or silencing in order to have an immuno-active effect on the tumor? The efficacy of a given immunological treatment is related to its ability to enhance, directly or indirectly, intratumoral inflammation. Investigators have recently tested the possibility of enhancing anti-tumor immune reaction by targeting immune- regulatory pathways, now broadly known as immune checkpoints. In solid tumors, objective responses occur in only a minority of patients (20-40%) and complete remission is still, and unfortunately, a rare phenomenon. The precise definition of molecular features associated with treatment response is a critical step for the development of a more efficient, personalized, immunotherapy.

The Fast Rotorcraft IADP of Clean Sky 2 consists of two flight demonstrators, the Next Generation Civil TiltRotor (NGCTR) [leader: Leonardo Helicopters] and the RACER compound helicopter [leader: Airbus Helicopters]. These two fast rotorcraft concepts aim to deliver superior vehicle productivity and performance, and through this economic advantage to users.  NGCTR aims to design, build and fly an innovative next generation civil tiltrotor technology demonstrator. The configuration will go beyond current architectures of this type of aircraft and will involve tilting proprotors mounted in fixed nacelles at the tips of the wing. The wing will have a fixed inboard portion and a tilting outboard portion to minimize rotor downwash impingement in hover and increase efficiency. Demonstration activities will aim at validating the technologies/systems and operational concepts.  The RACER (formerly LifeRCraft) aims at developing and flight-testing in 2020-2023 a full scale flightworthy demonstrator, which embodies the new European compound rotorcraft architecture.

Aiming at overcoming these drawbacks, a still open challenge is the identification of effective molecular targets common to all cancer types. In this frame, G-quadruplexes - i.e. non-canonical nucleic acid structures located at telomeres and oncogene promoters - emerged as appealing targets for general, selective treatment of cancer, due to their key role in regulation of typical mechanisms common to all cancer types. We recently identified a new hit compound, based on a water-soluble naphthalene diimide (hereafter named NDI) as G-quadruplex selective ligand exhibiting potent anticancer activity in vitro (low nanomolar range IC50). Simultaneously and selectively targeting telomeric and oncogenic G-quadruplexes by small organic molecules could produce a synergistic activity against cancer cells, without side effects on healthy cells. As a main requirement to evolve candidate drugs featured by low-to-null toxicity, a G-quadruplex ligand has to specifically recognize genomic G-quadruplexes, discriminating duplex DNA. Considering the promising results obtained for the above-mentioned NDI, we expect to improve its selectivity of action towards multiple G-quadruplexes and cancer cells by rational design of a focused library of its analogues. The rational design and synthesis of first-generation analogues of the above-mentioned NDI as G-quadruplex ligands will be performed, aiming at discovering lead anticancer candidate drugs ready for in vivo studies. By combining biophysical and in vitro analysis, we will get a deeper insight into the structural elements crucial for G-quadruplex vs. duplex selective recognition. This systematic study will allow correlating the G-quadruplex ligand chemical structure with their in vitro activity. Rational design and synthesis of a focused library of NDI analogues will be performed with the aid of NMR-based models of NDI/G-quadruplex complexes. Then, the evaluation of affinity and selectivity of the NDI analogues towards biologically relevant G-quadruplexes will be carried out by the G4-CPG assay, an affinity chromatography-based method we recently developed to rapidly and efficiently identify high-affinity G-quadruplex ligands, able to selectively recognize G-quadruplex over duplex structures. The strongest, most selective ligands will be then tested for their effective anticancer activity by biological assays on different cancer cell lines and healthy control cells, and genomic G-quadruplex targeting will be evaluated by specific assays. Finally, an in-depth biophysical study of the interaction with G-quadruplex models will be performed for the most active and less toxic analogues. We expect to validate our newly designed NDI-based molecules as strong G-quadruplex ligands, able to target multiple DNA G-quadruplexes - involved in molecular mechanisms typical of cancer cells - discriminating duplex DNA. In a hit-to-lead selection process, we expect the best ligands to exert marked anticancer activity on different cancer cells and low toxicity on normal cells, so to rapidly progress to in vivo studies. The discovery of a universal therapy based on a multi-target approach, causing limited-to-null toxicity, would allow caring all cancer patients regardless of the tumor types they are affected, developing a simple, but effective and low cost anticancer medical treatment for routine clinical practice.

100|grant.100086069|20POST35211151|Functional role of intracellular calcium in the regulation of vascular tone in heart failure|Functional role of intracellular calcium in the regulation of vascular tone in heart failure|Patients with heart failure (HF) have augmented vascular tone which increases cardiac workload, impairing cardiac output and adversely affecting outcomes. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the maladaptive vascular responses observed in HF are not fully understood. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) are the main cell type involved in vasoconstriction and calcium (Ca2+) is an essential player in such a process. Our hypothesis is that intracellular Ca2+ released by VSMC inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors plays a key role in the increased vascular tone observed in HF. To test this hypothesis, we generated (Cre/lox recombination technique) a mouse model in which these receptors have been specifically knocked-out in VSMCs. We have preliminary data showing that these mice display blunted responses to angiotensin II (ATII), both in vivo and ex vivo. We will evaluate vascular responses in a post-ischemic model of HF. We have preliminary data showing that VSMC-KO mice exhibit a significantly attenuated progression towards decompensated HF, with decreased afterload and attenuation of interstitial fibrosis. Notably, we did not detect any significant difference in the activation of the adrenergic and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. In vitro, we will determine the Ca2+ responses to PE and ATII in VSMCs isolated from KO and flox littermates. We have preliminary data showing that these responses were significantly blunted in KO mice, whereas no difference was detected when incubating with IP3R inhibitors. We will also test vascular reactivity in denuded mesenteric arteries preparations. Our proposal will identify an unprecedented role for IP3R, indicating that antagonism of the IP3R system may be of benefit in reversing increased vascular tone in patients with HF; vascular IP3R may thereby represent an important, novel target for therapeutic blockade in the pharmacological treatment of HF.

We believe that by taking advantage of advances in scientific understanding, and dramatically changing technological capabilities, earthquake hazard and risk will soon be appreciated not as a constant in time, but as an evolving, integrated and dynamic risk. In our concept, dynamic risk depends on location, changing with soil conditions, topography, structural type, occupancy and use and even location within a structure. However, dynamic risk also includes changes with time, for example increasing when a seismic sequence is active nearby and due to an improved dynamic geophysical understanding of faulting and earthquake processes. RISE proposes a series of coordinated activities in the domains of Operational Earthquake Forecasting, Earthquake Early Warning, Rapid Loss Assessment and Recovery and Rebuilding Efforts. Our approach is multi-disciplinary, involving earth-scientists, engineering-scientists, computer scientists, and social scientists. It is multi-scale in space and time, and addresses these scales in a highly systemic and consistent way. RISE joins with EPOS Integrated Core Service and several of the Thematic Core Services (TCS), with ARISTOTLE and the Copernicus Emergency Management Service. Integration will also include responsible national agencies in Italy, Turkey, Iceland, Israel and Switzerland and with selected industry partners. To maximise the impact of RISE, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team of truly outstanding researchers and practitioners, 37 PIs from 24 institutions (including 5 contributing partners from outside of Europe), in 13 countries, with documented experience on the topics of the project developed in previous FP6, FP7, and H2020 projects.

The development of aeronautical products is a complex multidisciplinary process with requirements and constraints on the air transport system as a whole, the aircraft, and all the individual components to be produced. A major challenge impeding an efficient and cost-effective design processes is the integration of the various levels of the aeronautical supply chain. Therefore, the aeronautical industry needs to connect all the people, skills and technologies involved in its collaborative, multi-national and cross organizational processes, by means of a digital representation of production systems, supply chains, and seamless operations across diverse disciplines, during the entire life-cycle of the product.   The high level objective of AGILE 4.0 is to bring significant reductions in aircraft development costs and time-to-market through the implementation of an integrated cyber-physical aeronautical supply chain, thereby increasing the competitiveness of the European aircraft industry, from integrators and high-tiers suppliers to SMEs, leading to innovative and more sustainable aircraft products.  AGILE 4.0 targets the digital transformation of main main pillars of the aeronautical supply-chain: design, production and certification and manufacturing.The composition of the AGILE 4.0 consortium and capabilities available enable to address realistic development scenarios integrating multiple stakeholders and covering all the aspects of the development of complex aeronautical systems.  AGILE 4.0 will provide the aircraft industry with a way to model, assess, and optimize complex systems addressing the entire life cycle. The technologies developed will enable stake-holders and actors of the aeronautical supply chain to perform trade-off which have never been possible to model before.

The ERC Grant ALLELECHOKER enabled the PI to discover three modes to generate transcriptional repression by transcription factors (TFs) based on Zinc-finger scaffold: i- synthetic transcription factor (TF; Mussolino et al., EMBO Mol. Med. 2011 Mar;3(3):118-28; Botta S. et al. Elife. 2016 Mar 14;5), ii- synthetic DNA-binding protein (Botta S. et al. Elife. 2016 Mar 14;5) and iii- the ectopic expression of an endogenous TF (Botta S, et al. JCI Insight. 2017 Dec 21;2(24). Thus, the PI demonstrated that transcriptional repression by TFs embodies a novel therapeutically effective mode to treat the toxic effects of gain-of-function mutations causing incurable inherited dominant disorders. In particular, mutations in the RHODOPSIN gene can cause the blindness disorder autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP). The PI demonstrated safety and efficiency of RHODOPSIN gene transcriptional silencing in pre-clinical animal models by a specific synthetic transcriptional repressor (ZF6-DB) delivered to the retina by an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector (AAV-ZF6-DB). Furthermore, within the ERC Grant ALLELECHOKER the PI showed that a single AAV vector containing two independent expression cassettes (AAV-ZF6-DB-hRHO), enables balanced silencing of RHODOPSIN by ZF6-DB and its simultaneous replacement with a human wild-type copy of the RHODOPSIN gene. The primary objective of the inSight ERC-PoC grant is to support AAV-ZF6-DB-hRHO clinical translation, with the final goal of bringing this therapeutic to patients suffering adRP through market authorization and commercialization.

These processes are governed by transient and dynamical macromolecular interactions that pose tremendous challenges to current analytical tools, as the majority of these methods perform best in the study of well-defined and poorly dynamical systems. This proposal aims at a radical innovation in the characterisation of complex processes that are dominated by structural order and disorder, including those occurring at the surface of biological membranes such as cellular signalling, the assembly of molecular machinery, or the regulation vesicular trafficking.  I outline a programme to realise a vision where the combination of experiments and theory can delineate a new analytical platform to study complex biochemical mechanisms at a multiscale level, and to elucidate their role in physiological and pathological contexts. To achieve this ambitious goal, my research team will develop tools based on the combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and molecular simulations, which will enable probing the structure, dynamics, thermodynamics and kinetics of complex protein-protein and protein-membrane interactions occurring at the surface of cellular membranes. The ability to advance both the experimental and theoretical sides, and their combination, is fundamental to define the next generation of methods to achieve our transformative aims. We will provide evidence of the innovative nature of the proposed multiscale approach by addressing some of the great questions in neuroscience and elucidate the details of how functional and aberrant biological complexity is achieved via the fine tuning between structural order and disorder at the neuronal synapse.

Batch reaction studies combined with in-situ 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, diffusion and relaxation techniques will give new and exclusive insights into these systems by providing quantitative data on intra-pore kinetics, diffusion and adsorption, which will be able to direct catalyst formulation and reaction design by evaluating the controlling interactions and mass transport phenomena of the various reactant/solvent/product species within the pores of the heterogenised catalytic system, hence aid selection of optimal reaction parameters such as choice of suitable solvents, solid supports, pore size and type of linker to immobilise the organocatalyst on support. The validation of this methodology in heterogenised organocatalysis will be a significant step forward towards effective screening and development of these materials, which can be expanded to other related technologies using functionalised porous materials.

Arguably, the planet has not only entered the Anthropocene, but also a 'Peri-cene': a global human-environment system shaped by peri-urbanization. Around the world the peri-urban displays many characteristics: global hubs and local enclaves, sprawl and disorder, disruption of communities and livelihoods, and in particular, growing climate risks and ecological disruption. Peri-urbanisation is both a material process of land-use change and impact, and a human process of social, economic, political, and cultural transitions: whether informal or planned, intensive or extensive, the peri-urban is critical to the provision of urban food, energy and water. In turn, understanding peri-urbanisation is critical to three Sustainable Development Goals: Goal 11 on Sustainable Cities and Communities, Goal 13 on Climate Action, and Goal 15 for Life on Land.   The PERI-CENE project will provide the first ever comprehensive assessment of peri-urbanisation climate impacts, risks and vulnerabilities. It will provide a global typology and global assessment with an inter-active peri-urban analysis tool. It builds an interactive Living Lab with 18 city-regions from around the world, and explores deeper issues in two case studies. The PERI-CENE then develops forward pathways to be scaleable and transferable.

The largest share of carbon emissions belongs to the production of electric energy from fossil fuels, which renewable energies are progressively replacing. Sunlight is an ideal renewable energy source since it is most abundant and available worldwide. Photovoltaic solar cells can directly convert the sunlight into electric energy by making use of the photovoltaic effect in semiconductors. Halide perovskites are emerging crystalline semiconducting materials with among the strongest light absorption and the most effective electric charge generation needed to design the highest efficient photovoltaic solar cells. The PI has the ambition to reinvent halide perovskites as environmentally friendly photovoltaic material, aiming at: (i) Removing lead: state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells are based on lead, which is in the list of hazardous substances of the European Union. The PI will prepare new tin-based perovskites and prove them in the highest efficient solar cells. (ii) Solvent-free crystallisation: organic solvents drive the crystallisation of the perovskite in the most efficient solar cells. However, crystallising the perovskite without using solvents is more environmentally friendly. The PI will establish physical vapour deposition as a solvent-free method for preparing the perovskite and the other materials comprising the solar cell. (iii) Durable power output: the long-term power output defines the solar energy yield and thus the return on investment. The PI aims to make stable tin-based perovskites addressing the oxidative instability of tin directly. The quantified target of FREENERGY is demonstrating a tin-based perovskite solar cell with power conversion efficiency over 20% and stability for 25 years. The research strategy to enable this disruptive outcome comprises innovative perovskites formulations and unconventional supramolecular interactions

These approaches have allowed a comprehensive analysis of microbiomes for the first time. Following initial curiosity-driven investigations of microbiomes using HTS technologies, the field has evolved to harness the insights provided, leading to the development of a new multi-billion euro industry focused on characterisation and modulation of microbiomes. The vast majority of this investment has been in the clinical space. In contrast, far less is known about microbiomes across complex food chains, making it difficult to harness food-chain microbiome data for the development of more sustainable food systems and to yield innovative products and applications. This is despite the evident importance of microbes throughout the food chain. MASTER will take a global approach to the development of concrete microbiome products, foods/feeds, services  or processes with high commercial potential, which will benefit society through improving the quantity, quality and safety of food, across multiple food chains, to include marine, plant, soil, rumen, meat, brewing, vegetable waste, and fermented foods. This will be achieved through mining microbiome data relating to the food chain, developing big data management tools to identify inter-relations between microbiomes across food chains, and generating applications which promote sustainability, circularity and contribute to waste management and climate change mitigation. We will harness microbiome knowledge to significantly enhance the health and resilience of fish, plants, soil, animals and humans, improve professional skills and competencies, and support the creation of new jobs in the food sector and bioeconomy.

In this project, the """"Lean Azimuthal Flame"""" (LEAF), a new combustor design that can operate at the """"Flameless Oxidation"""" mode and that has been tested for gaseous fuels so far producing very low NOx, CO, and unburnt hydrocarbons, will be developed for kerosene as an innovative low-NOx candidate combustor concept for the long-term. The work comprises tests at low and elevated pressures, development of new kinetic schemes for kerosene combustion under MILD combustions, development of experimental diagnostics and sectional models for nanoparticles so as to assess the particulate emissions of the kerosene LEAF and to increase our predictive capability, modelling by advanced combustion models (Large-Eddy Simulation with sub-grid Conditional Moment Closure supplemented with the new kinetic schemes for NOx and soot), and the construction of low-order models for emissions and thermoacoustics for the LEAF. The models can also assist the medium-term improvement of existing combustors such as those based on the RQL or LPP concepts. The consortium consists of four highly-experienced partners, with significant expertise with the LEAF, combustion in vitiated air, NOx and particulate emissions chemistry, and numerical modelling, and with emphasis on knowledge transfer to industry. The outcomes of the project can provide new options to the European aeroengine industry and can result in significanly lower NOx emissions than at present due to the unique low emissions of the """"Flameless Oxidation"""" combustion mode."""

To overcome these challenges, we propose a comprehensive computational effort to combine knowledge-base, machine-learning, and mechanistic models to predict optimal standard and experimental therapies for each child. Our approach is based on virtual patient models–in-silico avatars whose analysis can inform personalized diagnostics and recommend treatments. Our platform will also allow care givers to query models and infer benefits and drawbacks for specific treatment combinations for each child. To construct these models, we will combine state-of-the-art computational methods and data from molecular assays, and clinical and preclinical studies. We will test their predictions prospectively on data from clinical trials and test therapies in pre-clinical settings. We will focus on a select panel of paediatric tumours including both high-incidence and high-risk tumour types. To accomplish our goals, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team consisting of basic, translational, and clinical researchers—all amongst the leaders in their respective fields—and established strong relationships with European Centres of Excellence, patient organizations, and clinical trials focus on personalized medicine for our proposed case studies. We will produce, assemble, standardize, and harmonize accessible high-quality multi-disciplinary data and leverage the potential of Big Data and HPC for the personalized treatments of European citizens. We will make our models and data available through a cloud-based platform, whose exploitation will be maximised through a collaboration with the European Open Science Cloud initiative. In summary, iPC will address the critical need for personalized medicine for children with cancer, contribute to the digitalization of clinical workflows, and enable the Digital Single Market of the EU data infrastructure.

Intriguingly, these bumper crops occur simultaneously in plants living alongside each other, and synchronisation can extend across hundreds of kilometres. For example, we have previously shown that in 1976, 1992, 1995 and most recently in 2011, beech trees across Western Europe (including the UK, Germany, France and Poland) all produced heavy seed crops in the same year. Interestingly, 1992 and 1995 were also bumper years for pine-cone production in spruce forests in the same region.  This highly variable production of seeds is an important process in ecosystems. Producing seeds is a key step towards successfully establishing the next generation of plants. Masting is beneficial for plants because in years of bumper seed crops, seed predators cannot consume all the available seeds, which ensures that some survive to germinate the next spring. In ecosystems that are influenced by disturbance such as wildfires, windstorms and logging by humans, the timing of the next bumper seed year is also crucial to the ability of plants to regenerate. However, the importance of masting extends beyond plants. Bumper seed crops in forest trees represent a pulse of food resources, and cause population booms in small mammals (e.g. voles and mice) and seed-eating birds (e.g. woodpeckers and great tits). Low seed crops in sequential following years can eventually result in population crashes. These boom-and-bust cycles of small animals have further impacts on ecosystems. One of the most important for humans is the effect on tick numbers, which fluctuate in response to the number of host animals. Ticks act as a host for the Lyme disease pathogen, and research has shown that Lyme infection rates in humans peak two years after bumper seed crops in forest trees, including beech and oak. Masting is not just important in natural ecosystems, however. Many fruit and nut crops come from ""masting"" species. In agriculture, this phenomenon is usually known as ""alternate cropping"". Fruits grown in the UK, including apples and cherries, show this characteristic year-to-year variation in crop size, which causes variation in annual crop yield for farmers. It is also important in many other commercially valuable species, including olives, almonds and pistachios.   For these reasons, we need to be able to predict seed crops in ""masting"" species accurately. This information is necessary for the management of natural ecosystems and agricultural systems that rely on masting species. Furthermore, predicting bumper seed crops will allow us to forecast years of high risk from infectious diseases carried by animal feeding vectors, such as Lyme. An important question is how seed production in masting species will change in the future with changes in climate. This project is designed as the first crucial step to achieving these objectives. It will establish an international network of researchers to build the datasets necessary to understand the causes of bumper seed crops, and to predict seed production in masting species. We will draw together data from the tropics with data from boreal forests to understand how masting varies between species, and will use long-term monitoring conducted by members of the network to understand how seed production varies over time, and what triggers bumper seed years. We will also search archives and scientific literature for useful data: in a previous project we found useful data on seed crops collected by 18th century foresters, demonstrating that in some species, there is potential to develop very long records of seed production. The datasets that we will build in this project will then act as a spring-board for future research, including projects linked to public health, habitat management, and agriculture, taking advantage of the wide range of network expertise."

However, we are still far from a complete mechanistic understanding of many epigenetic processes. Without an understanding of mechanisms we cannot fully understand function in healthy cells, in disease states, and the effects and side effects of therapeutic interventions. This severely limits the development of healthcare strategies. Research in epigenetics has typically been based on experiments and not on theory. Although this has delivered large amounts of information, information alone is not sufficient. Further progress urgently needs a paradigm shift in the way in which we study epigenetics, namely: epigenetics needs mathematics. Mathematical models are essential to capture and understand the complex, dynamic and stochastic nature of epigenetic regulation. Models are immensely powerful because they identify unifying concepts and enable predictions of system properties. Modelling epigenetic processes not only holds the key to a deep mechanistic understanding, but also ultimately, to drug response predictions, patient-specific diagnoses and new therapies. One of the greatest challenges to uniting biology and mathematics is the barrier between disciplines, because education in each field has traditionally been mono-disciplinary. The PEP-NET ITN will overcome these barriers by uniting 16 outstanding European academic laboratories and companies who have pioneered the successful combination of theoretical and experimental epigenetics. PEP-NET will train a new cohort of 15 European researchers to combine quantitative experiments with predictive theoretical models, and to apply this knowledge to basic and applied questions of epigenetic function.

The objectives will be achieved by stacking ecosystem services to enhance synergistically the effective interplay of the service providers. Previous attempts at achieving this have been ineffective due to uncertainty of pollinator and natural enemy exchange between crop types and habitats, as well as the reluctance of growers to establish refugia for natural enemies and pollinators. In EcoStack we will focus on the management of beneficial organisms within the field, rather than trying to manage the external influx. We will make full use of increased knowledge of interactions between trophic levels (microbe-plant-herbivore-natural enemy / pollinator), and will manage and assess functional biodiversity benefits at different levels (within and between species, fields, landscapes), and stack them for maximizing farmer benefits and system resilience. Our research covers: conventional and organic cropping systems; arable, horticultural and permanent crops; pastoral and mixed systems, and all pedoclimatic production zones of Europe. Specific focus is on oilseed rape, wheat, and potato; field tomato; orchards (olive, fruit trees) and vineyards, and grassland/pastures. Advanced molecular and other technical tools are used to determine source populations of beneficial organisms, and to monitor and record movements and interactions. A comprehensive work-package will address relevant socio-economic questions including farmer uptake, and a specific tool will be developed based on precision agriculture data to allow farmers to link inputs (including functional biodiversity) to output (yield maps), based on data from their own fields. We have access to comprehensive farm networks covering all of Europe, for implementing and demonstrating our results.

A masonry structure can be considered as an assemblage of conventional or interlocking rigid blocks with frictional joints. Although interlocking blocks’ resistance to sliding is higher and their construction is easier when compared to conventional blocks, there is no digital framework to design structurally-sound assemblages composed of interlocking blocks with diverse typologies. Therefore, I intend to develop a digital framework that supports designers in the design of structurally feasible and assemblable masonry assemblages of interlocking blocks. The framework will accomplish the following: -it allows designers to model an assemblage and to analyze its structural feasibility; -for the structurally infeasible model, it will automatically modify the geometry of the interlocking blocks’ connectors, making the model structurally feasible;  -during the geometric modification, it will avoid geometries which do not construct the assemblable blocks.  To evaluate the structural feasibility, a novel experimental method will equate the frictional resistance of the corrugated face of an interlocking block to that of the flat face of an equivalent conventional block. I also propose an extension of the limit analysis method, in which block resistance to sliding is different in different directions, and plan to use equations from the experimental method. The project is an interdisciplinary research in the fields of architectural, computational and structural design and will train skills helping to establish me as a researcher leading studies on structurally informed architectural design as well as to become an entrepreneurial architect who uses masonry in contemporary architecture. It will also create opportunities for host organizations to collaborate with architectural academia and manufacturing industry in the field of integrated architectural-structural design.

Although mountains amplify risks, and even more so under extreme weather events, mountainous regions do not receive the same attention as densely populated urban areas in European disaster risk reduction plans. PHUSICOS's underlying premise is that nature itself is a source of ideas and solutions for mitigating the risk posed by climate-driven natural hazards. However, there is a lack of adequate proof of concept for NBSs to address hydro-meteorological events in rural and mountainous regions. PHUSICOS will fill the knowledge gap specifically related to NBSs for hydro-meteorological hazards (flooding, erosion, landslides and drought) by implementing NBSs at several European case study sites. These sites comprise 3 large-scale demonstrator sites Italy, Frane/Spain/Andorra and Norway; and 2 small-scale complementary concept cases in Austria and Germany.  The three demonstrator sites are representative of hydro-meteorological hazards, vegetation, topography and infrastructure throughout rural and mountainous regions in Europe. They have already guaranteed external financing and are currently in the process of implementing disaster risk reduction measures that are open to broader implementation of NBSs through the application of the PHUSICOS key innovation actions. The concept cases will be used for testing innovative ideas at local scale. PHUSICOS relies on a transdisciplinary consortium of 15 partners from seven European Countries, with expertise from public authorities, research institutes and universities to develop innovative actions on five fronts: technical, service, governance, learning arena and product innovations. PHUSICOS will also utilise the experience of three international partners and results of European research projects.

The size and complexity of the brain make this an expensive undertaking, but the costs associated with our current ignorance are rising and the potential gains from better insight into the brain are increasing. Brain-related diseases, many of which are age-related, now represent a major part of the global health burden and there are both ethical and economic imperatives to keep the growing number of older people healthier and more productive. Economic advantage is increasingly linked to artificial intelligence (AI), our ability to create technology to extract, manipulate and harness knowledge. The HBP’s comprehension of what makes the human brain so efficient and flexible should help to maintain Europe’s competitiveness and innovation potential in this area.  The HBP is one of several brain research initiatives and projects around the world, albeit one of the first, but it is unique in a number of ways. Only the HBP has an explicit focus on both neuroscience and computing. It is also the broadest and most integrated brain initiative, and the only one aiming to build a research infrastructure to accelerate brain research.  The HBP is a FET Flagship which started under FP7 and continues under H2020 with a succession of Specific Grant Agreements (SGAs) under a Framework Partnership Agreement (FPA). In its FP7 Ramp-Up Phase (2013-16) and subsequent SGA1 funding period (2016-18), the HBP implemented a scientific project of rare ambition, breadth and scale, and forged its diverse constituents into a functioning entity. On the scientific side, it not only identified critical gaps in our understanding of the brain, but also created tools and obtained data to fill many of them. It designed, built and demonstrated six ICT research platforms, supporting neuroinformatics, brain simulation, high-performance analytics and computing, medical informatics, brain-inspired computing and linking of simulated brains to robotic bodies. The results have been made available to the scientific community. The HBP also learnt to address underperformance and conflicts, and opened up the Project via competitive calls and the integration of Partnering Projects.  In the upcoming SGA2 funding period (2018-20), the HBP will continue to strengthen global brain research efforts by extending coordination with other brain initiatives and projects. Internally, it will continue its unique inter-disciplinary co-design approach, developing research infrastructure capabilities via use cases built around specific research needs. This approach will underpin its critical scientific work of understanding how to bridge between the different scales of brain organisation, a key prerequisite to understand the principles of brain organisation. It will include gathering data to support detailed modelling, notably of the human hippocampus, as well as structural, functional and connectivity data to improve systemic understanding of the whole brain. The HBP will also investigate brain similarities and differences between individuals and between species. It will model key brain functions, including visual recognition, slow-wave activity, episodic memory and consciousness in rodents and humans, and elaborate their cognitive architectures. In addition, it will develop simplified brain models to support further development of brain-inspired computing.  SGA2 will see the individual infrastructure platforms extended and integrated into the HBP Joint Platform (HBP-JP). The JP will make HBP services more robust and improve the user experience, encouraging wider use of its tools. SGA2 should thus see a shift from supplier-driven to user-driven capabilities, while the infrastructure underpinning them will be tied closely into EU efforts to integrate and stre

Geomaterial waste represents half of the waste volume generated in EU-27. These waste geomaterials generally exhibit poor engineering characteristics that prevent their direct reuse on construction/mining sites. However, if adequately treated, they could represent an excellent resource for construction purposes with significant money saving and reduction in the environmental footprint, thus contributing to the establishment of a circular economy. To achieve this, GeoRes will develop protocols, software and tools to improve the engineering characteristics of waste geomaterials, and to guarantee the level of performance over the service life of geostructures built from waste geomaterials considering site-specific conditions. The fundamental concern of the research in the GeoRes network is thus to develop strategies and tools for sustainable reuse of waste geomaterials generated by geoengineering activities, and to determine how to turn a waste geomaterial into a valued durable material, with a positive revenue stream. The proposed network is at the interface of two domains of engineering; geotechnical and geoenvironmental. Even today, it is not easy to find researchers with expertise in both geotechnical and geoenvironmental engineering. We intend to form a multidisciplinary and intersectoral consortium composed of 8 academic and 6 industrial beneficiaries and 6 Third Country partners which aim to address this problem. GeoRes will create a multidisciplinary and intersectoral network of creative and innovative researchers and practising engineers ready to face geotechnical and geoenvironmental engineering challenges which arise in the vanguard of technological innovation.

Since glycolysis is indispensable for development of human regulatory T (Treg) cells, a cellular compartment involved in prevention of autoimmunity, we aim at characterizing how genetic mutations of G6PT specifically impact on generation and function of conventional T (Tconv) and Treg cells.Background/Rationale: GSDs are a group of autosomal recessive metabolic disorders caused by deficiencies in the activity of the glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), resulting in alteration of glucose homeostasis. Patients with GSD-1b are also characterized by an increased frequency of autoimmune disorders such as Crohn's disease, thyroiditis and myasthenia gravis, which impact significantly on patient's quality of life and survival. Loss of immune tolerance and consequent autoimmunity associate with the failure of regulatory mechanisms mainly mediated by Treg cells. Our group has recently reported that glucose metabolism is indispensable for homeostasis of Treg cells, suggesting that a reduced glycolysis causes a defect in generation of Treg cells possibly leading to autoimmunity.Research design and methods for achieving the stated objectives: We intend to utilize a cellular and molecular approach to analyze the relationship between the genetic deficit in G6PT and T cell function, and provide fundamental information on the precise role of glucose metabolism in the maintenance of T cell tolerance.Anticipated output: Our approach should unveil the molecular basis of the genetic predisposition to increased autoimmunity risk in patients with GSD-1b and would lead to early detection of an altered T cell-mediated immunity in patients with GSD-1b.

How did accounts and individual memories of extreme events amount to authoritative interpretations? In which ways, and to what extent, did the latter orient collective behaviours and the recovery process, in both the short and the long term? Starting from the assumption that human relations are enhanced by the increased levels of socialisation that commonly occur in the aftermath of shocking events, which trigger the sharing of information, opinions and memories; and that the emotional impact of such events is likely to create a public opinion that draws attention to government’s action; the research proposal aims to contribute new insights into these issues by adopting an original methodology, developed across a variety of disciplines, including Cultural and Social History, Textual Criticism, Philology and Anthropology. Moreover, it will adopt a transnational perspective: since the selected regions belonged to the Spanish Monarchy, the development of practices and polices aimed to respond to disruption depended not only on the specific social and cultural features of local societies, but also on the circulation of political and technical staff, as well as on the sharing of knowledge, experiences and policy models, among the various areas of the Empire and its colonies. Studying the information exchange in the aftermath of disasters and the formation of an imagery of extraordinary events, will allow a comprehensive perspective on the policies and practices adopted by early modern societies to manage uncertainty, and on the potential impact that such narratives could have on the renegotiation of political and social relations.

Although researchers know about some of the enzymes that regulate their creation and destruction, Dr. Keller hopes to learn more about how the genes encoding these enzymes are modified. Her hypothesis is that a particular type of gene modification called DNA methylation may be necessary for correct brain development, and that methylation anomalies may lead to changes in gene expression that result in D-amino acid dysregulation, affecting schizophrenia risk.

The existing studies are either outdated or focus unilaterally on political and cultural history. The same applies for Italian historiography where the impact of economic and social issues has often been neglected especially after the cultural turn. The majority of the monographic overviews starts with the Napoleonic era. My project however sets in earlier and attempts to apply the concept of Sattelzeit systematically for the first time on Italy where this theory has hardly been employed. If placed into the context of the Italian states before 1789, the innovations of the liberal French legislation in Italy can be understood better. Furthermore, important impetuses of the reform period continued to affect Italian society even after the Congress of Vienna. Therefore, the validity of the term Restauration shall be examined critically regarding the Italian states. The volume will conclude with the conquest of Rome by troops of the young Italian nation-state in September 1870. From this date (forward), the entire Apennine belonged to the Kingdom of Italy. By choosing this chronological approach, a profound understanding of the first years of the new nation-state becomes possible, thereby highlighting the difficulties regarding the implantation of liberal laws and the centralistic administration.The planned monograph will offer an overview of recent historiography for the period 1770-1870. By referring to own interpretations, this concise synthesis including political, cultural, economic and social issues, shall set new priorities. One of these is to revise the existing cultural history studies critically. Various authors claim that Italians have been mobilized for the formation of a nation-state through literature, historiography, opera and painting on a massive scale thereby disproving older theses which state that the nation-state had been a project of the intellectual and ruling elites. They argue hermeneutically by analysing texts of classical high literature presuming their mobilizing effect without even trying to prove their reception. Finally, it seems appropriate to re-examine the overemphasis of the role of the upper middle classes/bourgeoisie which made up only 2-3% of Italy´s population. It is often overlooked that noblemen and commons collaborated in politics, culture and economy.

The aim of this part of the project – which was not foreseen in the original project and for which I am asking for a one-year extension – is to study some isagogical questions that may bear witness to the Socratic way of arguing. What I wish to show is that even those who believed it was impossible to infer any doctrine from the dialogues – namely, the Neo-Academics – derived from them a method to justify the use of reading schemes that were bound to support a doctrinal system. The didactic hints scattered throughout Plato’s dialogues gave certain discussions (and later doctrines) a methodological foundation. This method not only helped clarify certain discussions or doctrines, but also assigned them a truth content.

This approach captures synergies across needs and sources of flexibilities, such as multiple services from one source, or hybridizing sources, thus resulting in a cost-efficient power system. OSMOSE proposes four TSO-led demonstrations (RTE, REE, TERNA and ELES) aiming at increasing the techno-economic potential of a wide range of flexibility solutions and covering several applications, i.e.: synchronisation of large power systems by multiservice hybrid storage; multiple services provided by the coordinated control of different storage and FACTS devices; multiple services provided by grid devices, large demand-response and RES generation coordinated in a smart management system; cross-border sharing of flexibility sources through a near real-time cross-border energy market.     The demonstrations are coordinated with and supported by simulation-based studies which aim (i) to forecast the economically optimal mix of flexibility solutions in long-term energy scenarios (2030 and 2050) and (ii) to build recommendations for improvements of the existing market mechanisms and regulatory frameworks, thus enabling the reliable and sustainable development of flexibility assets by market players in coordination with regulated players.        Interoperability and improved TSO/DSO interactions are addressed so as to ease the scaling up and replication of the flexibility solutions. A database is built for the sharing of real-life techno-economic performances of electrochemical storage devices. Activities are planned to prepare a strategy for the exploitation and dissemination of the project’s results, with specific messages for each category of stakeholders of the electricity system.

CN is a life-threatening disease with no cure which constitutes a severe burden for the patients, their families, and the society. CureCN has the objective of developing a curative gene therapy for CN syndrome based on liver gene transfer with and adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector expressing the UGT1A1 transgene. Additional goals of CureCN are to develop strategies to allow for vector re-administration and to address the issue of pre-existing anti-AAV neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), which prevent large proportion of seropositive patients from receiving AAV mediated gene therapy. Proof-of-concept studies of AAV8-UGT1A1 gene transfer provide a strong rationale for the safety and efficacy of gene therapy for CN. CureCN proposes to carry out an open-label, multicenter clinical trial of AAV8-UGT1A1 gene transfer to prove the safety and efficacy of the therapy in severe CN patients, and file for marketing authorization in Europe at the end of the study. CureCN will also produce enabling data for the clinical translation of a groundbreaking immunomodulatory strategy to allow for vector administration. Additionally, a technology for the selective removal of anti-AAV NAbs from the bloodstream of seropositive patients will be developed. The goal of these studies is to ultimately allow all CN patients to access AAV8-UGT1A1 gene therapy. CureCN is a patient-driven initiative that gathers top clinicians and scientists; it also includes small medium enterprises in its partners, to foster economic growth and valorization of intellectual property. CureCN sets itself in the ambitious goal set by the IRDiRC by 2020 by developing a curative treatment for CN syndrome. Importantly, it validates technologies that will broaden the scope of gene therapy, thus will have an impact on the development of treatments for several other rare diseases.
100|grant.7161286|172988|An integrated approach to plant adaptation|An integrated approach to plant adaptation|Biotic and abiotic factors are both major drivers of plant adaptive diversification, however, their combined impact on the adaptive process is little understood. Most studies on habitat (abiotic) adaptation use model species with obligatory selfing that do not rely on pollinators for fruit set, and studies targeting adaptation to pollinators or herbivores often do not control for soil or climate parameters. In the here proposed research, adaptation to abiotic and biotic factors will be investigated in a combined way, using studies in natural population as well as experimental evolution. As a model species, the outcrossing Brassica rapa with a generalized pollination system will be used. In natural populations, adaptation will be investigated with reciprocal transplant experiments; different fitness parameters such as growth (biomass), pollination success, and herbivory will be included. Biotic and abiotic environmental factors will be recorded. In addition, the molecular bases of adaptation will be studied using genome scans for loci under selection and association studies between environmental factors and plant genotypes. In a second approach, the process of adaptation will be studied using experimental evolution, by mimicking biotic and abiotic environmental heterogeneity found in natural populations. Experimental evolution will be used to document additive/non-additive phenotypic selection and adaptive evolution in response to different pollinators and soil types. Parallel molecular evolution will be investigated by comparing evolutionary changes in allele frequencies and gene expression in independent replicates within treatment groups, as well as between experimental and field populations. The planned research has the potential to lead to groundbreaking insights into process and pattern of plant adaptation, a phenomenon important in the context of global change as well as crop breeding.

As a large number of compounds, including common anti-inflammatories, antibiotics, hormones, pesticides and and herbicides, is added to the priority substances watch list for future regulation, there is an urgent need for novel technologies capable of degrading micropollutants safely and without generating significant increases in carbon emissions of the water industry, already accounting for about 5% of UK emissions.  Legacy technology comprising the majority of water treatment plants in the UK and other developed countries cannot remove micropollutants, requiring an additional treatment step to be added to the water treatment train. Alternative technologies currently being tested in the UK and abroad all have limitations, in terms of high energy costs or high capital costs or production of toxic by-products, which require further removal. The urgency of addressing this issue is witnessed by estimates of multi-billion pound capital investments and £B/year operating costs faced by the UK water industry, to address impending legislation mandating the removal of micropollutants. In fact, the European Water Industry Platform has concluded that the chance of removing micropollutants without significant increases in energy consumption with current technology is 'very low', and that this can be achieved only by 'leapfrogging traditional, polluting and resource-intensive technologies', a view shared by the UK government.   Photocatalysis, considered the leading technology to treat micropollutants, suffers from a twin-set of limitations that have hindered more widespread adoption so far. Slurry reactors, where wastewater is mixed with a slurry of photocatalytic nanoparticles under UV illumination, can effectively degrade micropollutants but require costly downstream retention of the particles to avoid their leaching into the environment. Reactors with immobilised catalysts, on the other hand, have significantly lower activity due to lower contact area and higher light scattering. Furthermore, preliminary evidence of potential adverse health effects arising from the accumulation of nanoparticles in the environment, has convinced UK's Environment Agency, DEFRA and health authorities to block their use in water treatment.  My vision as an EPSRC Established Career Fellow in Water Engineering is to safely degrade micropollutants without significantly increasing carbon emissions or producing toxic by-products. I will achieve this by creating novel photocatalytic nanoporous anodic metal foams, combining the high surface area of slurries and the stability of immobilised systems requiring no downstream removal. The combination of a metallic core and a metal oxide coating will enable boosting photocatalytic activity by using a small electrical potential, decreasing the need for low-efficiency electricity-to-light conversion. My ambition is to address the twin challenges that have so-far hindered the use of photocatalysis in water treatment: the potential leaching of photocatalytic slurries in the environment and the low efficiency of UV light illumination, which translates in low activity, for immobilised photocatalysts.

They can be either permanent (covalently crosslinked) and resist flow, or physical (reversible) and easy to process while creeping at long times. The grand challenge is to efficiently combine and control within the same material, distinct features of these two classes of networks, such as large mechanical strength, deformability, swelling and self-healing, in order to create multiply responsive materials for new applications.  The objective of DoDyNet is to develop a research roadmap that enhances our understanding of the synergistic effects arising by combining distinct dynamic modes within a polymeric network. These ‘Double Dynamics Networks’ (DDNs) are characterized by a multi-scale viscoelastic response that can be tuned via molar mass, fraction of component and dynamics of (transient or exchangeable) bonds. This will enable us to selectively tailor their macroscopic properties at molecular level.  Based on this concept, the integrated research program involves (1) novel synthesis of different DDNs; (2) detailed analysis of structure; (3) rheology and dynamics; (4) modeling and simulations; and (5) mechanical properties relevant to applications. The ESRs will benefit from the close inter-connection among these complementary tasks with the goal to obtain criteria for designing and developing new industrial DDN systems and optimizing existing materials.  DoDyNet is a highly interdisciplinary and inter-sectorial project, the groups involved are world-leaders in their fields, and the tasks strategically designed to ensure strong synergies. It offers young researchers an extraordinarily diverse training platform with a deep grasp of soft matter and unique exposure to industrial environment, needed to address emerging scientific and technological challenges.

Its full potential has not been achieved yet because of the complexity of engineering biological systems where basic biological parts are intrinsically noisy and not modular. The overarching goal of COSY-BIO is to develop a theoretical framework and innovative technological tools to engineer reliable biological systems that are robust despite their individual components being not by translating principles of control engineering to molecular and cell biology. Automatic control is a well-established engineering discipline to build “controllers” to steer the dynamic behaviour of a physical system in a desired fashion. By building upon control engineering for physical systems and by exploiting the unique features of living organisms, this project will identify generally applicable approaches to design closed-loop feedback controllers for biological systems. To handle biological complexity, the project will explore three strategies of increasing difficulty “external” controllers, “embedded” controllers and “multi-cellular” controllers. External controllers will be implemented in a computer acting on cells using small molecules via microfluidics devices. Embedded controllers will be made from biological parts and integrated within individual cells to steer their behaviour. Multicellular controllers envisage two cell populations, one made up of cells with embedded controllers (controller cells) and the other will be the controlled population (target cells). In addition, a rapid prototyping platform will enable to speed up the design-build-test cycles by means of optimal experimental design, microfluidics and cell-free systems. Proof-of-principles demonstrations in bacteria and yeast with relevance to biotechnology will be tackled to prove the usefulness of this revolutionary technology.

The construction sector is responsible for 7% of carbon emissions in the UK. The UK target for 80% reduction in carbon emissions by 2050 (against the 1990 baseline) presents both challenges and tremendous opportunities for the UK construction sector in the transition towards a low-carbon economy. The use of cementitious materials is pervasive in conventional ground improvement techniques, and with cement production contributing 5-7% of total global CO2 emissions there is a clear need for the development of new ground improvement technologies.   Over the last ten years the geotechnical engineering research community has witnessed the creation of a new subdiscipline: biogeotechnics a multi-disciplinary field at the interface of biology, geochemistry, soil mechanics, and geotechnical engineering. This represents a paradigm shift in geotechnical engineering- until now the accepted view has been to consider the ground as sterile and inert; now engineers are exploring the potential for use of biological and biochemical processes in ground engineering applications. This proposal represents the first steps towards the development of a novel low-carbon, minimal intervention, biologically based technology using engineered fungal networks.  Biological soil crusts in nature (consisting of fungi, bacteria and other organisms) are known to withstand erosion due to water or wind action. This project will investigate filamentous fungi, i.e. fungi which grow hyphae (tube-like structures). It is thought that fungal hyphae behave similar to plant roots - penetrating between soil particles and entangling them -helping to bind soil particles together, but on a smaller scale. Furthermore, fungi can secrete biochemical products, which may also contribute to binding of soil particles. This project will systematically quantify the mechanical benefit of fungal treatment in soils by investigating three different types of fungi and their ability to enhance the behaviour of different soil types. The project will determine the conditions required for rapid fungal network growth to occur and optimise the orientation of hyphal development to give maximum mechanical benefit. The dataset arising from the proposed experimental campaign will act as a springboard for the development of a new range of nature inspired ground improvement technologies.  The research proposed could transform how we consider the design of, development and deployment of ground improvement technologies. Rather than subject the ground to different energy intensive or invasive techniques, this research proposes to 'grow' the required level of treatment through the use of fungal networks. The process could be engineered using external stimuli to orient the hyphal networks as required for site-specific applications. This project will investigate the feasibility of the deployment of fungal networks as a ground improvement technology.

The Large Area Telescope collaboration operates a gamma-ray telescope onboard the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope mission and has revolutionized our view of the gamma-ray Universe, by increasing the number of known sources, unveiling new classes of gamma-ray emitters, and probing particle acceleration and electromagnetic emission in space with unprecedented detail. Fermi is the reference all-sky gamma-ray monitor for the follow-up searches for electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave sources. The multimessenger astronomical observations will soon be enriched by X-ray polarization detectors.

100|grant.6382989|NE/P002145/1|Evolutionary rescue and the limits to phenotypic plasticity: testing theory in the field|Evolutionary rescue and the limits to phenotypic plasticity: testing theory in the field|Rapid climate change and habitat loss will cause many species to become extinct this century unless they can cope with changing and more extreme ecological conditions. Understanding what limits species' ecological tolerances is therefore an issue of critical scientific importance because it allows us to predict the consequences of ongoing rates of environmental change to populations and therefore to ecological communities.   A common way that organisms deal with environmental variation is to be 'plastic', i.e. to change their morphological, physiological or behavioural traits (their phenotypes) directly in response to their local environment, without requiring rapid evolutionary change. Such 'phenotypic plasticity' buffers changes in the environment, and can maintain fitness across the range of environments typically experienced by a species. Currently, most of the global responses of biodiversity to climate change have been ascribed to such phenotypic plasticity, rather than to actual evolutionary change, underlining its importance in maintaining ecological outputs.  However, the ability of phenotypic plasticity to cope with environmental change has limits. Not only is maintaining variation in gene expression likely to be energetically expensive, it also evolves to maintain fitness only within the range of environments a species experiences in its recent past. In novel or extreme conditions, there is therefore no reason that a species' plastic responses will still improve their ability to survive and produce offspring. Instead, plastic responses that were adaptive in former environments may actually reduce their fitness in new environments. This idea is especially worrying because it predicts that plasticity will be unable to cope as ecological change continues, leading to sudden population declines as critical environmental limits are exceeded. By contrast, other theoretical models predict that plastic responses will be able to evolve more quickly in novel environments, generating faster evolutionary responses than predicted by laboratory experiments under common garden conditions.   We will test these theoretical predictions by measuring the plastic responses of two ecologically divergent species of ragwort (genus Senecio) to changes in their altitudinal position, both within and outside their prevailing distributions on the slopes of Mount Etna, Sicily. These species, Senecio aethnensis and S. chrysanthemifolius differ in a number of phenotypic traits, as well as in the expression of key genes that are associated with adaptation to different altitudes. We will transplant genotypes of both species into a range of field conditions and monitor their performance and plasticity over a two-year period in order to determine each genotype's response to conditions outside its normal ('home') environment. We will measure growth and development parameters, and reproductive parameters as a measure of each genotype's local fitness, and test the degree to which the declines in fitness expected with changes in altitude are offset by plastic changes in their phenotype and in gene expression.   We predict that although observed plastic responses will keep individuals healthy and productive under their species' usual range of altitudinal conditions, phenotypic responses will no longer be appropriate with altitudinal changes beyond these limits. Such an empirical finding will have important implications for predicting the continued ability of species to respond plastically to climate change. In particular, it will suggest, the rapid evolution will be necessary to prevent population and species' extinction where rates of environmental change exceed prevailing conditions within their geographical range.

Combined water and nutrient stress is a major problem for tomato farmers and solutions are needed to safeguard yields, while preserving the environment. TOMRES will select, among over 10,000 available accessions, rootstocks and scions tolerating combined stress, while retaining fruit quality and yield, taking advantage of innovative screening approaches. Novel traits, in particular belowground, to be exploited in breeding, will be identified. The role of selected hormones (strigolactones and brassinosteroids) will be studied to identify further resilience traits.  TOMRES will test and optimize sustainable crop management strategies such as legume intercropping, precision fertilization and irrigation techniques, manipulation of symbiotic microorganisms, and the use of rootstocks more suited to water and nutrient uptake from the soil.  Novel genotypes X management strategies will be developed with the goal of reducing N and P application by at least 20%, water input by 40%, while granting environmental sustainability and economic viability of the solutions proposed. Testing will be integrated with analysis of environmental (greenhouse emissions, water quality), and of socio-economic impact. Agronomical, environmental, and economical data will be processed to construction of models and of a Decision Support System.  Demonstration and dissemination activities will follow the whole course of the project, and will transfer the results to different environments and other cropping systems, thus ensuring the widest impact of the gained knowledge on the EU economy. Trans-disciplinary knowledge transfer among farmers, breeders, industries, associations and scientists will be granted by a solid multi-actor approach since the planning stage.

Understanding what limits species' ecological tolerances is therefore an issue of critical scientific importance because it allows us to predict the consequences of ongoing rates of environmental change to populations and therefore to ecological communities.   A common way that organisms deal with environmental variation is to be 'plastic', i.e. to change their morphological, physiological or behavioural traits (their phenotypes) directly in response to their local environment, without requiring rapid evolutionary change. Such 'phenotypic plasticity' buffers changes in the environment, and can maintain fitness across the range of environments typically experienced by a species. Currently, most of the global responses of biodiversity to climate change have been ascribed to such phenotypic plasticity, rather than to actual evolutionary change, underlining its importance in maintaining ecological outputs.  However, the ability of phenotypic plasticity to cope with environmental change has limits. Not only is maintaining variation in gene expression likely to be energetically expensive, it also evolves to maintain fitness only within the range of environments a species experiences in its recent past. In novel or extreme conditions, there is therefore no reason that a species' plastic responses will still improve their ability to survive and produce offspring. Instead, plastic responses that were adaptive in former environments may actually reduce their fitness in new environments. This idea is especially worrying because it predicts that plasticity will be unable to cope as ecological change continues, leading to sudden population declines as critical environmental limits are exceeded. By contrast, other theoretical models predict that plastic responses will be able to evolve more quickly in novel environments, generating faster evolutionary responses than predicted by laboratory experiments under common garden conditions.   We will test these theoretical predictions by measuring the plastic responses of two ecologically divergent species of ragwort (genus Senecio) to changes in their altitudinal position, both within and outside their prevailing distributions on the slopes of Mount Etna, Sicily. These species, Senecio aethnensis and S. chrysanthemifolius differ in a number of phenotypic traits, as well as in the expression of key genes that are associated with adaptation to different altitudes.

Among the different varieties of agriculture species, the wine-grapes are specially threatened by climate change, since subtle differences in microclimate impacts directly through over-ripening, rising acidity levels, greater vulnerability to pests and diseases, etc., resulting in changes in wine quality and properties. The wine industry needs therefore to tackle adaptation measures, and long term adaptation planning will provide producers with a comparative advantage over competitors.   VISCA is a Climate Service (CS) and Decision Support System (DSS) that integrates climate, agricultural and end-users´ specifications in order to design medium- and long-term adaptation strategies to climate change. VISCA will be validated by real demonstration with end-users on three demo sites belonging to three wine stakeholders from Spain, Italy and Portugal, which are included as partners in the consortium (Codorniu, Mastroberardino and Symington).  The main objective of VISCA is making South-European wine industries resilient to climate changes, while minimizing costs and risks through an improvement of the production management (quality and quantity of final product). This objective will be achieved with the integration of climatic data, phenological , irrigation models, and end-users’ requirements into a Decision Support System (DSS) co-designed with wine producers from Spain, Italy and Portugal. VISCA will supply well-founded decisions of specific aspects of crop planning (e.g., budburst, harvesting, defoliation, minimum water needs), and suggest preventive actions against extreme events and long-term suitability maps.
100|grant.6503171|ST/P001173/1|MICE Ionization-Cooling Demonstration|MICE Ionization-Cooling Demonstration|The Neutrino Factory is a possible future accelerator facility that creates beams of neutrinos from the decays of muons in a storage ring. The neutrino beams from a Neutrino Factory would have the highest intensity and can be controlled with unprecedented accuracy. For these reasons, the Neutrino Factory has the potential to discover measurable differences between neutrino and antineutrino oscillations, which could be the key to understanding the puzzle of the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe. This phenomenon, known as CP violation, has been observed in the quark sector but has never been seen in the neutrino sector. A future Neutrino Factory would determine CP violation in the neutrino sector with the best possible accuracy. Furthermore, a Neutrino factory could be used as a first stage before the construction of a Muon Collider, which could be used to measure the properties of the Higgs boson with the ultimate precision, and could potentially reach energies of up to 6 TeV, in order to explore new physics phenomena at the highest energy frontier.  Both the Neutrino Factory and a Muon Collider rely on the acceleration of muons. To be able to create muon accelerator facilities, we require to reduce the size of the muon beam so that it may be accelerated. Since muons decay within 2 microseconds in their own rest frame, the only known way to reduce the phase space of the muon beam before the muons decay is to use the concept of ionisation cooling, in which the muons lose energy in an absorber such as liquid hydrogen or lithium hydride (LiH) and then recover the longitudinal component of the momentum by accelerating them using RF cavities. The international Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) is an engineering demonstration of the concept of ionisation cooling. This experiment is being built at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, in which a beam of muons will be cooled in a muon cooling cell consisting of three absorbers and two RF cavities inside the field of two focus coil magnets. The emittance of the beam is measured before and after the cooling channel using a scintillating fibre tracker inside a superconducting solenoid, and the muons are identified using time-of-flight detectors, a Cherenkov detector and a calorimeter system consisting of a scintillating fibre-lead pre-shower detector (named the KL) and a totally active scintillating detector, called the Electron Muon Ranger (EMR).   In this proposal we aim to perform measurements of emittance reduction, without RF cavities (MICE step IV) and perform the final demonstration of ionization cooling with RF cavities. This proposal is a bid for 42 months funding from October 2016 to April 2020, supporting academic and student effort over that period and research staff from the end of the bridging support that ends in December 2016.

These challenges span wide swathes of society, business and research. Astronomers with their high-tech observatories are historically at the forefront of this field, but obviously, the  impact in e.g. commercial applications, security, environmental monitoring and  experimental research is immense. We aim to contribute to this general discussion by training a number of young scientists in the fields of computer science and astronomy, focussing on techniques of automated learning from large quantities of data to answer fundamental questions on the evolution of properties of galaxies. While these techniques will lead to major advances in our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies, we will also promote, in collaboration with industry, much more general applications in society, e.g. in medical imaging or remote sensing. We have put together a team of astronomers and computer scientists, from academic and private sector partners, to develop techniques to detect and classify ultra-faint galaxies and galaxy remnants in a deep survey of the Fornax cluster, and use the results to study how galaxies evolve in the dense environment of galaxy clusters. With a team of young researchers we will develop novel computer science algorithms addressing  fundamental topics in galaxy formation, such as the huge dark matter fractions inferred by theory, and the lack of detected angular momentum in galaxies. The collaboration is unique - it will develop a platform for deep symbiosis of two radically different strands of approaches: purely data-driven machine learning and specialist approaches based on techniques developed in astronomy. Young scientists trained with such skills are highly demanded both in research and business.The duration of the project was originally 48 months, till 31/3/2021.

The scientific underpinning of SI and related policy is evolving and therefore we need to provide support to farming using the most advanced evidence and knowledge. The principle innovative step in this work package (WP) is to develop new tools (metrics of sustainability) which accommodate the new knowledge taking into account the mechanistic constraints that underlie the trade-offs between productivity, efficiency and resilience of agricultural systems. The new metrics will be informed by indicators of soil health for enhanced efficiency of nutrient utilization (ENU) at the soil-plant-microbe interface and in collaboration with the ASSIST strategic programme on the function of non-crop biodiversity and soil abiotic stress. The work will focus on the means of achieving the mechanistic targets from WP1 by mapping those on to management targets that can be operationalised on-farm. The North Wyke Farm Platform (NWFP), Rothamsted Long Term Experiments (LTE) and Large Scale Rotation Experiments (LSRE) provide the unique capability to link nutrient stocks and flows at the plant scale (studied in WP1) to detailed measures of stocks and flows at the farm scale (losses, yield and quality) that will be studied in this WP. This analysis will convert a set of indicators that relate current best knowledge on mechanistic target states (developed in WP1) to 'fit-for-purpose' SI metrics that can be routinely measured on farms that do not benefit from the exhaustive instrumentation of the NWFP. The indicators represent a hypothesised relationship linking mechanisms to management that will be validated and further developed into metrics using existing experimental farm platforms (NWFP and LTE), the new LSRE, and the commercial farm networks established within the ASSIST programme.
100|grant.6542094|EP/P013112/1|Novel Hybrid Heat Pipe for space and ground applications|Novel Hybrid Heat Pipe for space and ground applications|Industry demand for high heat transfer capability, efficient thermal control, flexibility and low cost has motivated researchers to develop a new generation of passive systems mainly based on fluid phase-change. This project proposes the modelling and the experimental characterisation of a novel wickless heat transfer device applicable both on the ground and in space. The name Hybrid Heat Pipe (HyHP) comes from the fact that the well-established loop thermosyphon (TS) is here transformed to a plain serpentine device with one evaporator for each turn, as a pulsating heat pipe (PHP).  Why do we need a new wickless heat device? Two-phase heat transfer devices play an important role in a variety of engineering fields; TSs, for example, are already successfully implemented in nuclear and solar plants, while heat pipe applications range from electronics cooling to the automotive sector. But the actual systems have two major problems: 1) dissipation of high thermal powers maintaining high heat fluxes has significant limits connected to the upscale of the internal wick and the system dimensions, 2) the deployability or the flexibility of the passive two-phase systems is quite reduced.  How does HyHP work? The vertical operation in gravity, as well as the distinctive location of the heating and the cooling sections, causes the fluid to circulate regularly in a preferential direction guaranteeing stable operation and homogeneous temperature distribution of the system. The combination between channel dimension and working fluid is chosen in such a way that the device will operate in thermosyphon mode on the ground and, in the case of weightless conditions, in capillary mode, i.e the liquid completely fills the tube section and therefore vapour expansion and contraction cause an oscillation of the liquid/vapour patterns. Why do we need a new project on HyHP? Because, although in 2014 a first HyHP prototype was built and the first ground and microgravity experiments were successfully carried out, we are far from understanding all the physical phenomena inside a HyHP and our ability to simulate the processes involved is still quite limited, i.e. we are not able to design a HyHP to manage heat within given boundary conditions. Numerical analyses are fundamental to understanding the possible advantages and drawbacks of the HyHP and to predict its performance. The development and the use of innovative numerical tools and theoretical approaches will provide an insight into the physical phenomena and the governing mechanisms of a HyHP, opening the route to more efficient and customised design. These numerical studies will be supported by parallel extensive experimental campaigns. A prototype with an Infrared (IR) and Visible Spectrum (VIS) window will be designed, built, equipped with several sensors and tested both on the ground and in micro-gravity conditions. ESA has already offered us partial funding and access to the parabolic flight campaigns. It is expected that the primary beneficiary of this research will be the space industry; however advantages are not confined to this specific field, as the support of two ground-based companies indicates. Since the novel design of HyHPs combines technological aspects from both TSs and PHPs, the numerical tools we develop will be relevant to all industries concerned with thermal management. The investigation will benefit the scientific and industrial sectors by providing an open-source CFD tool for the simulation of general phase-change heat transfer phenomena. Finally the project is contributing to the growing of the new Advanced Engineering Centre of the University of Brighton, which starts with a initial investment of £14M with the aim of delivering world leading research in the sectors of Internal Combustion Engines, Thermal Efficiency and System Efficiency, and Thermal Management for Ground and Space Applications.
100|grant.6503317|EP/P013651/1|Modelling sperm-mucus interactions across scales|Modelling sperm-mucus interactions across scales|The process of the sperm reaching the egg is the reason we are all here, but we often don't stop to think, why was it that particular sperm and not one of the billions of others? If we do, we usually assume that it was all up to chance and that the sperm that provided half of our genetic make up simply had about a one-in-a-billion shot of being the one. This, however, is not the complete story and, as experimental evidence shows, the female tract deploys a variety of biochemical and biophysical mechanisms to actively select the most viable sperm cells, allowing only this group the chance at fertilising the egg. Understanding the mechanisms at play is not only fundamental to our understanding of reproductive biology, but also crucial to effectively diagnosing and treating cases of infertility.   One key player in sperm selection is mucus: the complex fluid through which the sperm cells must swim. When we think of mucus, we often think of a slimy and gooey substance. The gooeyness is due to the fact that mucus in comprised of a network of elastic filaments suspended in water. Due to its small size, a sperm cell, rather than experiencing the gooeyness, instead experiences the network as a series of obstacles with which it must interact as it tries to swim. During fertile periods, the properties of the filament network change to allow healthy, viable sperm to pass, while filtering out the rest. It remains unclear, however, which network properties enable this remarkable differentiation between healthy and abnormal sperm cells. Developing a clear understanding of the underlying mechanics of sperm-filament network interactions could pave the way for the development of new diagnostics, based on synthetic artificial mucus environments, as well as new fertility treatments.   The goal of this project is to use mathematical modelling to quantify these sperm-network interactions and explore how they impact sperm selection. The models we develop will be able to examine how both the shape and swimming characteristics of individual sperm affect its ability to move through networks of different properties, as well as how the interactions affect the motion of multiple sperm and sperm populations at scales close to the female tract itself. To do this, we will develop two kinds of mathematical models. The first model will provide a microscopic description of the coupled motion of the sperm cells and filaments by resolving the details of the fluid flows generated by the swimming sperm, the bending and stretching of the network filaments, and the collisions between the sperm cells and network filaments. This model will allow us to explore in great detail how different network properties affect the motion of individual or small groups of sperm cells with different swimming characteristics and morphologies. The second model will describe the dynamics of sperm populations in the female tract at the longer time and larger length scales not accessible to the first model. This model will be derived using a rigorous coarse-graining methodology to systematically eliminate degrees of freedom from the more detailed model while still ensuring relevant effects are captured consistently. Using this model we can explore en masse sperm selection and link population-level differentiation with details of the sperm-mucus interactions.  We aim for these mathematical models to have the two-fold effect of pushing forward fields associated with applied mathematics such as scientific computing, fluid mechanics, non-linear partial differential equations, and multiscale analysis, but also providing important inroads of using mathematics to impact the biological sciences and medicine. A key aspect of our project is to interface with active fertility clinicians and reproductive biologists and explore with them how our models coupled with their laboratory techniques might be used in the future to enhance clinical data and provide better patient outcomes

They also directly feed on agricultural plants, reducing agricultural production and causing empty stomachs for the poorest and huge economic losses for farmers. The world's climate is changing allowing insects to invade new regions and reproduce faster. A growing human population puts a rising strain on the worlds agricultural systems while at the same time insects are becoming increasingly resistant to our most powerful weapon - insecticides. The global burden insects pose on human health and society is therefore expected to increase. These challenges are forcing us to envision novel ways in which we can sustainably control insects.  Genetic control of insects is a form of biological control where the release of modified insects reduces or eliminates the potential of wild insect populations to do harm. For example the mass-release of sterilized males has been used to reduce the population size of many insect pests for many decades.  One such genetic control strategy is to strongly bias the sex ratio of a population towards males so that the population, due to a lack of females, decreases in size or is eliminated altogether. Normally half of a male's sperm carry the Y-chromosome and go on to make males whereas the other half carries the X chromosome and go on to make females. A gene that biases the production of sperm towards those that carry the Y-chromosome is refereed to as a sex ratio distorter. We have, for the first time, generated such a distorter gene which destroys the X-chromosome by cutting its DNA in many places and successfully tested it in the malaria mosquito. The biology of the mosquito allowed us take a shortcut, as ""molecular scissors"" that could cut the DNA of the mosquito's X-chromosome were already available and could be used with little modification.  In this project we want to explore whether similar distorter genes can also be created for many other insect pest or vector species and to destroy their respective X-chromosomes. First we will develop a bioinformatic algorithm that is able to identify, using DNA sequences from male and female insects, positions where the X-chromosome can be cut. We will then use the novel CRISPR ""molecular scissor"" technology to cut the X-chromosome when sperm are made and study the effect on the progeny. If it works and only sperm carrying the Y survive we will find that these insects now produce mostly male offspring.  We will first test this approach in the fruit fly Drosophila, as the fly is a genetic powerhouse allowing many genetic experiments to be concluded quickly and efficiently. If successful we will then test this technology in one well studied insect pest species for example Ceratitis capitata, the Mediterranean fruit fly capable of damaging many fruit crops. We will show that male flies carrying the distorter gene when placed in a cage with a population of normal flies will reduce that population or even eliminate it.  If it works our control strategy can in the future be applied to protect food crops from insect pests or humans and animals from insect-borne diseases.  Technical Summary We seek to establish sex-ratio distortion by X-chromosome shredding as a new genetic control strategy that can be applied to populations of a wide variety of insect pests of agriculture or vectors of human and animal diseases.  It has long been theorized that inducing extreme reproductive sex ratios could be a powerful genetic method to eliminate insect pest populations. We have recently generated the first synthetic sex distortion system in the malaria mosquito. We showed that this system was powerful enough to eliminate caged populations of this important vector via the mass release of transgenic males. However, to establish this system we exploited the peculiar genetic makeup of A. gambiae namely that the mosquito's rDNA repeats are located exclusively on the X-chromosome. Using an endonuclease known to cut a conserved sequence within the rDNA destroyed the paternal X-chromosome during spermatogenesis, a process termed X-shredding, preventing it's transmission to the progeny and resulting in >95% male offspring.  To render this technology more broadly applicable to any pest or vector species with suitable sex chromosomes we are developing a bioinformatic pipeline that is able to identify sequences that are present exclusively and abundantly on an organism's X-chromosome. We have validated a prototype of this tool that takes as an input only unassembled long and short genome sequencing reads. We are using the Drosophila model to target a number of such sequence repeats and to establish the criteria of functionality for CRISPR based X-shredders. We are performing short and long read genome sequencing on a number of prominent pest and vector species to determine their suitability for this approach and we finally seek to establish a fully functioning X-shredder transgene in one chosen target species. The ability of CRISPR-based X-shredders to bias the sex ratio towards males would constitute a powerful new tool for the area-wide control of harmful insects."

Symptoms usually begin in feet and legs, and only later on reach hands and arms. There is currently no treatment available to cure this disease. Foot ulcers and recurrent infections, which often lead to amputations of the toes, further characterize the type 2B form of the disease, also called ulcero-mutilating. This form is caused by mutations in the rab7 gene. Rab7 is a protein important for the correct form and functioning of lysosomes, the digestive system of all cells, and thus it is not yet clear why alterations of this protein cause problems only to nervous cells of the peripheral nervous system.This project is the result of the collaborative effort of three scientific groups with different expertise and proposes to study the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this disease, a necessary step to identify possible treatments in the future. In particular, we propose to study the effects of the mutations of the Rab7 protein on the morphology and function of lysosomes, the digestive system of the cell, and on the degeneration and regeneration processes of the axon, a part of the nervous cell fundamental to conduct nerve impulses. To do that we will use stem cells derived from the skin of the patients in order to produce peripheral nervous cells. This will allow us to perform experiments on patient-derived cells displaying the defect. The discovery of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this disease will allow the identification of targets for designing future effective therapeutical strategies. Furthermore, full understanding of these mechanisms could give new insights for other forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth due to similar alterations.

For this reason Engine manufacturer are deeply looking to innovative design for oil lubrication and heat management system implementing architectures that are able to meet the new cooling and lubricating requirements without negatively impacting the Engine weight or operational and maintenance costs.  The overall objective of project DEVILS Project is to research, develop and validate the robustness of a new variable oil flow approach towards the design an innovative variable flow oil pump to be integrated in a high performance aircraft lubrication systems architecture with the aim of reducing fuel and oil consumption.  Objective of DEVILS project is as well to research, implement and validate smart fault detection and health monitoring algorithms to assist the system in reducing oil low flow rate needs and prognostic functions.

The vitamin has long been viewed as mere antioxidant. Meanwhile, the focus of basic research shifted to non-redox mechanisms, and it has been hypothesized that vitamin E is converted into bioactive metabolites, as known for other fat-soluble vitamins. Our data indicate that the vitamin E metabolite 13'-carboxy-alpha-tocopherol is endogenously formed in the body and contributes to the anti-inflammatory properties of vitamin E through inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase - a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of immunoregulatory lipid mediators. In the present proposal, we will in detail investigate the binding mode and inhibitory mechanism of vitamin E metabolites and characterize 13'-carboxy-alpha-tocopherol as endogenous metabolite in human primary immune cells, in a biochip-based microperfused three-dimensional liver organoid as well as in a mouse model of inflammation. Our results will provide insights into the complex mechanisms of vitamin E and might be of major importance for the design and interpretation of vitamin E supplementation studies.

As of today’s technology development stage – economic competitiveness restricted to low temperature applications; technology implementation requiring interference with existing heat production systems, heat distribution networks or even heat consuming processes -  Solar thermal potential is mainly identified for new industrial capacity in outside Americas and Europe. In this context, INSHIP aims at the definition of a ECRIA engaging major European research institutes with recognized activities on SHIP, into an integrated structure that could successfully achieve the coordination objectives of: more effective and intense cooperation between EU research institutions; alignment of different SHIP related national research and funding programs, avoiding overlaps and duplications and identifying gaps; acceleration of knowledge transfer to the European industry, to be the reference organization to promote and coordinate the international cooperation in SHIP research from and to Europe, while developing coordinated R&D TRLs 2-5 activities with the ambition of progressing SHIP beyond the state-of-the-art through: an easier integration of low and medium temperature technologies suiting the operation, durability and reliability requirements of industrial end users; expanding the range of SHIP applications to the EI sector through the development of suitable process embedded solar concentrating technologies, overcoming the present barrier of applications only in the low and medium temperature ranges; increasing the synergies within industrial parks, through centralized heat distribution networks and exploiting the potential synergies of these networks with district heating and with the electricity grid.

We will use human biomonitoring to understand human exposure to chemicals and resulting health impacts and will communicate with policy makers to ensure that our results are exploited in the design of new chemicals policies and the evaluation of existing measures.    Key objectives include: • Harmonizing procedures for human biomonitoring across 26 countries, to provide policy makers with comparable data on human internal exposure to chemicals and mixtures of chemicals at EU level;  • Linking data on internal exposure to chemicals to aggregate external exposure and identifying exposure pathways and upstream sources. Information on exposure pathways is critical to the design of targeted policy measures to reduce exposure; • Generating scientific evidence on the causal links between human exposure to chemicals and negative health outcomes; and • Adapting chemical risk assessment methodologies to use human biomonitoring data and account for the contribution of multiple external exposure pathways to the total chemical body burden. We will achieve these objectives by harmonizing human biomonitoring initiatives in 26 countries, drawing on existing expertise and building new capacities. By establishing National Hubs in each country to coordinate activities, we will create a robust Human Biomonitoring Platform at European level.  This initiative contributes directly to the improvement of health and well-being for all age groups, by investigating how exposure to chemicals affects the health of different groups, such as children, pregnant women, foetuses and workers. We will also investigate how factor such as behavior, lifestyle and socio-economic status influence internal exposure to chemicals across the EU population. This knowledge will support policy action to reduce chemical exposure and protect health.

Innovative strategies to deliver a next generation of drugs are urgently needed. The alarming threats and spread of multi-drug resistant bacteria is currently leaving clinicians with very limited options to combat infections especially those from Gram-negative pathogens.   The Train 2Target research programme focuses on the assembly of the well-known bacterial cell envelope from a new perspective. Indeed it aims to inhibit novel targets in envelope biogenesis by altering the function and misbalancing the coordination of envelope assembly machines, which build and assemble the Gram-negative bacterial envelope. A wide variety of chemical classes and compounds sources will be screened using innovative biochemical, biophysical and genetic assays to identify valuable hit scaffolds to be optimized into druggable leads.   The high quality and credibility of our consortium is ensured by a strong interdisciplinary academia-industry partnership to encompass different complementary expertise ranging from microbiology, bacterial genetics, biochemistry, cell imaging, structural biology, biophysics and chemical synthesis. Our 9 academic groups are all renowned leaders in the cell envelope biogenesis field, whereas the complementary 5 SMEs and 3 Industry partners are specialised in drug discovery and development of novel anti-infective drugs. This unique combination of scientific excellence and industrial know-how in drug discovery covers the entire process from the design to the implementation of innovative antibacterial strategies and lead identification.  Train2Target also represents a unique research platform to train 15 Early Stage Researchers and equip them with the necessary scientific and transferable skills that will make them highly competitive for both top European research institutions and the pharma/biotech job market.

IRD patients witness inexorable progressive vision loss as no therapy is currently available. In the last decade my group has significantly contributed to a change of this scenario by developing efficient adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors for retinal gene therapy that are safe and effective in humans. The objective of EYEGET (EYE GEne Therapy) is to overcome some of the current major limitations in the field of retinal gene therapy to expand initial therapeutic successes to a larger number of IRDs. To achieve this, we propose to use four parallel, highly innovative and complementary approaches: i. expansion of the limited AAV cargo capacity by a novel methodology based on co-administration of multiple AAVs that reassemble in target retinal cells and reconstitute large genes; ii. targeting of frequent dominant gain-of-function mutations that cause RP using state-of-the-art AAV-mediated genome editing technologies; iii. induction of retinal cells clearance of toxic IRD products by AAV-mediated activation of autophagy and lysosomal function; iv. development of methodologies to directly convert fibroblasts to photoreceptors that can be transplanted in retinas from IRD patients with advanced PR loss and for whom in vivo gene therapy is no longer an option. We will use a combination of in vitro and in vivo state-of-the-art technologies including novel AAV vector design, high content screening of drugs that enhance AAV transduction, genome editing, and advanced in vivo retinal phenotyping to obtain proof-of-concept for each of these therapeutic strategies. The results from this study may impact the quality of life of millions of people worldwide by providing a cure based on gene and/or cell therapy for a large group of IRDs.

100|grant.6542230|NE/P018947/1|Lessons for the future: Qualifying and quantifying South Asia's first widespread ciguatera poisoning outbreak|Lessons for the future: Qualifying and quantifying South Asia's first widespread ciguatera poisoning outbreak|South Asia has long had a fish eating tradition as well as a growing domestic and export fishing industry. However, recently there have been sporadic reports of ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) from this region. This is a circumtropical disease transmitted by eating carnivorous fishes that contain toxins accumulated from their food and is characterised by gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms which may result in disablement and/or death. Despite the known presence of the dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus spp., one of the most common causative agents of CFP, in the region (Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea) there has been no previously recorded large-scale CFP incident in this area until now. On 1st October 2016 South Asia's first widespread CFP outbreak occurred in the city of Mangalore, Karnataka, on the coast of SW India, resulting in several hundred hospital attendances and admissions. This is believed to be as a result of the consumption of locally caught carnivorous fish, such as the red snapper, Lutjanus bohar, contaminated with ciguatera toxins. These fish were originally intended for a fish processing plant in the city but were also sold at the Mangalore fish market. This recent outbreak presents a unique opportunity to qualify and quantify the presence of the causative algal species, whilst at the same time conduct state-of-the-art toxin analysis of contaminated seafood samples in a region of the world currently underrepresented both in terms of sampling coverage and technological analysis of an algal-born toxin outbreak event. Increased seawater temperatures and lowered salinity are known to favour the regional dinoflagellate community in general, and specifically Gambierdiscus spp. The previous 12 months have seen sea surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean consistently 0.5-1.0 degrees C above average coinciding with the ongoing El Niño Southern Oscillation and this season's monsoon has been particularly sustained, lowering coastal salinity. Data gathered during the proposed study will allow us to make predictions for the occurrence of further outbreaks of CFP along the South Asian coastline and elsewhere, including in the face of global climate change. Our aim to implement a rapid response screening and management programme in response to future CFP events will help to ensure the health and wellbeing of those who depend on fishing as a protein and/or economic resource.

Liver transplantation is currently the only treatment for preventing toxic amyloid deposition in the organs. Since 2011, tafamidis meglumine is available in Italy only for ambulant patients without any help and it seems promising, but now new disease-modifying RNA therapies are on the horizon.There are still many unresolved questions in the genotype-phenotype correlation and about inter- and intra-mutation variability. Moreover, there are very few data on longitudinal functional changes, psychosocial burden of patients and caregivers and epidemiological distribution in Italy. We are developing a TTR-FAP National Registry, where we will collect clinical and genetic information of the disease, and measure disease course in 1-year period.We plan to follow the patients by several already validated scales and tools to investigate neurological, cardiological and psychological impairment. 6-minute walk test will be validated as a reliable measure for future trials. Participants in the National Registry will be asked to give a written informed consent and to choose the nearest clinical centre among nine centres, where he/she wants to be followed during the 1-year longitudinal study. We expect to enroll approx. 272 symptomatic patients and approx. 100 asymptomatic TTR gene mutation carriers. Data will be then analysed and will provide epidemiological data on Italian TTR-FAP patients, define natural history of the disease, standards of care, disease burden and patients' needs, and facilitate feasibility and planning of future clinical trials

European OEMs and automotive manufacturers need new long term technologies, still to be implemented by 2030. Currently, hybrid powertrains are considered as the main trend to achieve clean and efficient vehicles. EAGLE project is to improve energy efficiency of road transport vehicles by developing an ultra-lean Spark Ignition gasoline engine, adapted to future electrified powertrains. This new concept using a conventional engine architecture will demonstrate more than 50% peak brake thermal efficiency while reducing particulate and NOx emissions. It will also reach real driving Euro 6 values with no conformity factor. This innovative approach will consequently support the achievement of long term fleet targets of 50 g/km CO2 by providing affordable hybrid solution. EAGLE will tackle several challenges focusing on: • Reducing engine thermal losses through a smart coating approach to lower volumetric specific heat capacity under 1.5 MJ/m3K • Reaching ultra-lean combustion (lambda > 2) with very low particulate (down to 10 nm) emission by innovative hydrogen boosting • Developing breakthrough ignition system for ultra-lean combustion • Investigating a close loop combustion control for extreme lean limit stabilization • Addressing and investigating NOx emissions reduction technologies based on a tailor made NOx storage catalyst and using H2 as a reducing agent for SCR.  A strong engine modeling approach will allow to predict thermal and combustion performances to support development and assess engine performances prior to single and multi-cylinder test bench application. An interdisciplinary consortium made of nine partners from four different countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain) will share its cutting-edge know-how in new combustion process, sensing, control, engine manufacturing, ignition system, simulation & modeling, advanced coating, as well as after-treatment systems.

The case study is the chain of Late Roman fortified settlements that punctuate the Kharga Oasis (Egypt’s Western Desert), that in the Fourth Century represented a portion of the southern boundary of the empire. All these sites, located in a remote and harsh environment, share the same architectural features and are endowed with similar agricultural installations, thus suggesting the existence of a highly motivated large-scale strategy of occupation of the region. A detailed study of Umm al-Dabadib, the best-preserved site, will produce a consistent set of criteria to be applied to the analysis of its less-preserved companions. In turn, a comprehensive study of these self-contained and self-sufficient settlements with a strong military flavour will allow a reconstruction of the Late Roman strategy of control over the desert routes that met in this oasis, and will offer an important contribution to the debate on the defence of the empire’s borders in the historical period from Diocletian to Constantine and beyond to the end of the Fourth Century. The sites will be studied using a combination of classic and innovative investigation techniques: 3D survey of the architectural remains, archaeological excavation of specific portions of both the built-up areas and the agricultural systems, archaeobotanical analyses, ceramic studies, analyses of satellite images, all carried out within the wider frame of an environmental study of the area and a historical analysis of the textual sources. The dissemination will take place both through the usual channels (publications on paper) and through an innovative information system accessible to scholars all over the world, which will fully exploit the potential of the latest survey technique.

Our objective is to provide local and regional authorities with an innovative transdisciplinary open source geodesign decision support environment (GDSE) developed and implemented in living labs in six metropolitan areas. The GDSE allows creating integrated, place-based eco-innovative spatial development strategies aiming at a quantitative reduction of waste flows in the strategic interface of peri-urban areas. These strategies will promote the use of waste as a resource, thus support the on-going initiatives of the EC towards establishing a strong circular economy. The identification of such eco-innovative strategies will be based on the integration of life cycle thinking and geodesign to operationalise urban metabolism. Our approach differs from previous UM as we introduce a reversed material flow accounting to collect data accurate and detailed enough for the design of a variety of solutions to place-based challenges. The developed impact and decision models allow quantification and validation of alternative solution paths and therefore promote sustainable urban development built on near-field synergies between the built and natural environments. This will be achieved by quantifying and tracking essential resource flows, mapping and quantification of negative and positive effects of present and future resource flows, and the determination of a set of indicators to inform decision makers concerning the optimization of (re-)use of resources. The GDSE will be open source. With a budget of €5 million, REPAiR funds a consortium rich in experience in waste and resource management, spatial decision support, territorial governance, spatial planning and urban design, and has deep knowledge of the 6 case study areas. REPAiR is supported by a user board, of key stakeholders for the development of CE as well as local authorities, who are heavily involved in the GDSE testing.

In its State of the Nation Infrastructure 2014 report the Institution of Civil Engineers stated that none of the sectors analysed were ""fit for the future"" and only one sector was ""adequate for now"". The need to future-proof existing and new infrastructure is of paramount importance and has become a constant theme in industry documents, seminars, workshops and discussions. - Increased loading: Existing infrastructure is challenged by the need to increase load and usage - be that number of passengers carried, numbers of vehicles or volume of water used - and the requirement to maintain the existing infrastructure while operating at current capacity. - Changing climate: projections for increasing numbers and severity of extreme weather events mean that our infrastructure will need to be more resilient in the future.  These challenges require innovation to address them. However, in the infrastructure and construction industries tight operating margins, industry segmentation and strong emphasis on safety and reliability create barriers to introducing innovation into industry practice.  CSIC is an Innovation and Knowledge Centre funded by EPSRC and Innovate UK to help address this market failure, by translating world leading research into industry implementation, working with more than 40 industry partners to develop, trial, provide and deliver high-quality, low cost, accurate sensor technologies and predictive tools which enable new ways of monitoring how infrastructure behaves during construction and asset operation, providing a whole-life approach to achieving sustainability in an integrated way. It provides training and access for industry to source, develop and deliver these new approaches to stimulate business and encourage economic growth, improving the management of the nation's infrastructure and construction industry.  Our collaborative approach, bringing together leaders from industry and academia, accelerates the commercial development of emerging technologies, and promotes knowledge transfer and industry implementation to shape the future of infrastructure. Phase 2 funding will enable CSIC to address specific challenges remaining to implementation of smart infrastructure solutions.   Over the next five years, to overcome these barriers and create a self-sustaining market in smart infrastructure, CSIC along with an expanded group of industry and academic partners will: - Create the complete, innovative solutions that the sector needs by integrating the components of smart infrastructure into systems approaches, bringing together sensor data and asset management decisions to improve whole life management of assets and city scale infrastructure planning; spin-in technology where necessary, to allow demonstration of smart technology in an integrated manner.  - Continue to build industry confidence by working closely with partners to demonstrate and deploy new smart infrastructure solutions on live infrastructure projects. Develop projects on behalf of industry using seed-funds to fund hardware and consumables, and demonstrate capability. - Generate a compelling business case for smart infrastructure solutions together with asset owners and government organisations based on combining smarter information with whole life value models for infrastructure assets. Focus on value-driven messaging around the whole system business case for why smart infrastructure is the future, and will strive to turn today's intangibles into business drivers for the future.  - Facilitate the development and expansion of the supply chain through extending our network of partners in new areas, knowledge transfer, smart infrastructure standards and influencing policy."

Rocket nozzles of solid/hybrid rocket motors must survive harsh thermochemical and mechanical environments produced by high performance solid propellants (2700-3500°C). Thermal protection systems (TPS) for space vehicles flying at Mach 7 must withstand projected service temperatures up to 2500°C associated to convective heat fluxes up to 15 MWm-2 and intense mechanical vibrations at launch and re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere. The combination of extremely hot temperatures, chemically aggressive environments and rapid heating/cooling is beyond the capabilities of current materials. Main purpose of C3HARME is to design, develop, manufacture, test and validate a new class of out-performing, reliable, cost-effective and scalable Ultra High Temperature Ceramic Matrix Composites (UHTCMCs) based on C or SiC fibres/preforms enriched with ultra-high temperature ceramics (UHTCs) capable of in-situ repairing damage induced during operation in severe aerospace environments. C3HARME will apply to two main applications: near-ZERO erosion rocket nozzles that must maintain dimensional stability during firing in combustion chambers, and near-ZERO ablation thermal protection systems enabling hypersonic space vehicles to maintain flight performance. C3HARME represents a well-balanced mix of innovative and consolidated technologies, mitigating the level of risk intrinsic in top-notch research and innovation development.

In order to do so, MAGIC deploys a set of novel, cutting-edge and system-oriented approaches that originates from system ecology, bio-economics and Science and Technology Studies. Their combination allows MAGIC to highlights if a certain mix of EU policies results in undesirable or unforeseen outcomes. Climate, water, land energy, and food modeling are integrated into a socio- and bio-economics framework using an iterative and participatory method. Significant care is taken to embed these ideas and approaches within the advisory and decision making functions of the European Commission.  Impacts are twofold.  First, MAGIC contributes a methodological framework where the needs for advice of different DG in the design of development strategies for the EU are covered using a method that can embrace the complexity of the nexus, for a better understanding of the interactions it holds.   Second, the project provides ‘on the flight’ advice to the EC about the timeliness and soundness for the EU 2020 Strategy and the EU position in international agreements of EU policies -like the Water Framework Directive, the Common Agricultural Policy, or the Low-Carbon Economy Strategy- and targets of implementing technologies -such as fracking, desalination, biofuels and GMOs.

The project vision is a full-fledged spin-orbit photonic science and technology, and its achievement will be pursued by moving in three main directions: 1) We will develop innovative systems based on spin-orbit optical media for generating light fields exhibiting a complex spatial vector structure, both in two dimensions (transverse plane and transverse fields) and in three (i.e. involving time- and space-dependent polarization fields and longitudinal field components). We will extend these ideas to other spectral domains (terahertz waves) and explore the possible applications of these fields in areas such as optical manipulation, plasmonics, space-division multiplexing in optical fibers, time-domain terahertz spectroscopy, ultrafast optics. 2) We will exploit spin-orbit quantum correlations generated within single photons and/or among few correlated photons to demonstrate novel quantum-information protocols using both the polarization and the transverse modes to encode and manipulate multiple qubits in each photon and for the implementation of quantum simulations of material systems based on photonic quantum walks in the Hilbert space of the light transverse modes. 3) We will investigate novel or unexplained physical processes occurring in structured optical media and light-sensitive material systems which respond both to the optical polarization and to its spatial inhomogeneity. Such materials will then be used to manipulate and characterize spin-orbit vector states of light.

Earthquake Induced Liquefaction Disasters (EILDs) is responsible for tremendous amounts of the structural damages and fatalities; with experiences from recent events giving example of where approx. half of the economic loss was directly caused by liquefaction. Liquefaction is a phenomenon, with previously a low profile until recent earthquake events, in which the stiffness and strength of soil is reduced by seismic activity. With the causes of Liquefaction being known, it is important to recognize the factors that contribute to its occurrence; as well as the resulting hazards. The theory on how to address the subject has been comprehensive, as well as the engineering to reduce its consequences of liquefaction already developed; however, recent findings and advances need to be accurately examined in order to implement mitigation strategies practically. A systematic approach is needed for assessing the possibility of liquefaction on a site, prior to construction, then implementing the most appropriate liquefaction mitigation techniques. However, the variability of circumstances, invariably translates to multiple approaches of implementation, based on the susceptibility of the location to liquefaction, as well as the type and size of structure. The LIQUEFACT project addresses the mitigation of risks to EILD events in European communities with a holistic approach. The project not only deals with the resistance of structures to EILD events, but also, the resilience of the collective urban community in relation to their quick recovery from an occurrence. The LIQUEFACT project sets out to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of EILDs, the applications of the mitigation techniques, and the development of more appropriate techniques tailored to each specific scenario, for both Europe and global.

Such systems, in which autonomous agents interact and strategize to achieve private and/or common objectives, are central in many endeavours of high potential societal impact, such as the development of smart cities or robotic rescue teams for nuclear accidents. Because of the criticality of many application areas, there has been over the recent years an important and rising effort to  bring together the formal methods community and the MAS community in order to develop theoretical paradigms and practical tools to help design provably correct multi-agent systems. The logical approach has until now been particularly successful. The most recent and promising proposal was made by Chatterjee, Henzinger and Piterman, who in 2010 introduced Strategy Logic, a logic tailored to reason about rich game-theoretic notions in multi-agent systems. This logic enjoys very interesting properties and has been well studied, but much remains to be done.  In most real-life applications, agents only have imperfect information about their environment. Typically, rescue robots each have only a local, partial view of their environment. Their sensors may even get damaged during the mission, due to radiations for example. Considering imperfect information deeply impacts the strategizing process, and it also calls for a modelling of agents' uncertainty. In this project we propose to extend Strategy Logic to account for imperfect information and to allow for reasoning about agents' knowledge.

Its deep comprehension has relevant consequences in Mathematics, Physics, Astronomy and Astrophysics.  The problem is by its nature perturbative, being well approximated by the much easier (and in fact exactly solved since the XVII century) problem where each planet interacts only with the sun. However, when the mutual interactions among planets are taken into account, the dynamics of the system is much richer and, up to nowadays, essentially unsolved. Stable and unstable motions coexist as well.  In general, perturbation theory allows to describe qualitative aspects of the motion, but it does not apply directly to the problem, because of its deep degeneracies.  During my PhD, I obtained important results on the stability of the problem, based on a new symplectic description, that allowed me to write, for the first time, in the framework of close to be integrable systems, the Hamilton equations governing the dynamics of the problem, made free of its integral of motions, and degeneracies related. By such results, I was an invited speaker to the ICM of 2014, in Seoul. The goal of this research is to use such recent tools, develop techniques, ideas and wide collaborations, also by means of the creation of post-doc positions, assistant professorships (non-tenure track), workshops and advanced schools, in order to find results concerning the long-time stability of the problem, as well as unstable or diffusive motions.

The principal objective of the Project is to establish a long-lasting collaboration, to provide a possibility for transfer of knowledge, to enable exchanges of research personnel, and to create an intercontinental network in the area of oceanographic Data Assimilation (DA). The focus is on the improvement of the numerical algorithms of computational science environments able to exploit the high performance that will be available at the exascale. The main expected scientific result of the Project will be the design and development of scalable approaches to DA based on domain decomposition methods, communication avoiding algorithms, and hybrid parallel implementations on multiprocess/multi-thread paradigms, for 4-dimensional Variational (4DVar) DA models designed for efficient use in OCMs in real time. The new algorithms will be implemented and tested in the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS), which is a most popular framework in which a 4DVar model has been developed, and validated using data collected in the enclosed and semi enclosed seas, such as West Africa/Angola, Mediterranean, North Sea and Caspian sea.  The expertise of the consortium partners is mutually complementary, and encompasses the development of numerical models and scalable algorithms for DA (UNINA, ANL), the study of various observed and predicted data in real applications (ICL) that are coupled with the development and the implementation of these methods in ROMS 4DVar (UCSC, UNINA) to be tested on emerging supercomputers (BSC-CNS). Realization of the Project will strengthen the scientific potential of DA models integrated in OCMs and will contribute to the sustainable development in participating Partner Countries. Ethical issues of the research will be duly addressed.
100|grant.8748485|NNJ16HP23I|GCR Simulator Validation Studies with Human and Mouse Models|GCR Simulator Validation Studies with Human and Mouse Models|This project addresses NASA’s request to help design and validate its planned galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) simulator. Space radiation has two major components: GCR, which is comprised of highly energetic ions from protons through uranium, and solar particle events, which are primarily moderate energy protons. Most currently funded NASA ground-based studies in radiobiology examine one highly energetic ion at a time because of facility limitations. While this approach provides insight into the biological effect of each particle, insight into potential interactions from particles of different energies or charges is missed and the deep space environment is not accurately copied. Recent improvements in facility capability allow mixed beam exposures to more closely approximate the GCR, but questions remain about the final composition of the beams to be included. We will build upon our prior work on single particle-induced mutations in cultured cells and mice (cancer-relevant endpoints). Work with cultured cells will be performed because it will provide data more quickly, aid with cross-species extrapolation of risks, and inform the mouse work. We will first measure the effects of acute exposures to alpha particles (charged helium nuclei) because basic information about this GCR component is lacking. Next, we will measure the effect of acute exposures to a mixture of protons, alpha particles, and silicon ions to mimic the effect of a simple GCR simulator model, followed by acute exposures to the final GCR mixture that is chosen (informed in part from our first two experiments). Finally, we will determine the effects of a protracted exposure to the GCR simulator, which will reflect more closely exposures that will occur in the space environment. Our results will help NASA to both design and validate the GCR simulator. The purpose of this project is to provide input to NASA's risk model for cancer regarding exposure to accelerated charged particle radiations that simulate those found in space.  The work is designed to address cancer development processes at relatively low doses and fluences that are space-relevant. The project specifically uses different types of charged particle radiations alone or in combination to determine whether it is possible to predict the effects of multiple ions from the effects measured in studies using single light or heavy charged particle beams.    This work is of relevance to naturally occurring Earth-based exposures to densely ionizing radiations such as radon. It will also inform our understanding of the mechanisms underlying potential risks to normal tissues associated with the implementation of charged particle radiation therapy.  Progress in the final period of this project included the completion of studies with 3 sequential ion beams rapidly delivered to mouse kidney epithelial cells in culture and a cohort of B6D2F1 mice.  The results showed simple additivity for the genotoxicity studies (cell death, autosomal mutation) with cultured kidney cells.  Mutagenesis studies in the mouse model produced less than additive results at the highest dose point.  Subsequent studies were performed using both the cultured kidney cells and a separate cohort of B6D2F1 mice exposed to 6 sequential ion beams to more closely resemble the complex GCR environment.  The results were similar to the results obtained with 3 sequential ion beams.  In addition, supplemental behavioral and cognitive studies were performed with the mice exposed to 3 beams or to 6 beams.  There was considerable variation in the results between the two studies, but the object recognition studies showed similar effects of exposures to complex charged particle beams of importance for space flight.  Human lymphoid cell studies included exposures with He ions alone to round out an extensive set of single ion studies funded by NASA over many years.  The results indicate that high energy He ions have similar toxicity and mutation induction to equal doses of energetic protons, but that they are 4x more effective than protons on a per particle basis.    Additional studies examined the effect of combined exposures to 3 ions delivered rapidly.  The results indicate that the toxicity of the combined exposure could be predicted from the single ion results, as could the mutant frequency data.    Dose-rate studies with multiple ions were performed using two approaches:  continuous low dose-rate  or split dose with moderate dose-rate.  The results indicate reduced cytotoxicity for low dose-rate exposures but little or no sparing for mutant frequency.  Molecular analysis using whole genome SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism) analyses was initiated on a large number of murine kidney epithelial samples from some single and multi-beam exposures and for human lymphoid cells.  The results are pending.

In families with children affected by severe and unknown diseases, the lack of diagnosis results in significant emotional distress, uncertainty about prognosis and recurrence risk. In addition, it precludes the use of available therapies or promotion of research initiatives and strategies to investigate novel treatments. Current technologies are rapidly evolving, allowing the parallel sequencing of billions of DNA fragments. This technological advance opens up the possibility of understanding the cause of diseases by studying all human genes. Although the process is straightforward, it is not as simple as it may appear to the general public. Analysis of all coding sequences in the human genome detects thousands of genetic variants, many of which are of unknown significance. A major challenge is the identification of the causative gene defect among these variants. This key task is performed through a multi-step process. Firstly, in addition to the undiagnosed patient, unaffected family members are evaluated for the presence of the variants and, secondly, other patients sharing the same pattern of abnormalities and carrying the same variant are searched worldwide. The matching process is the most important step leading to the identification of the disease-causing gene. This project aims at identifying the causes of undiagnosed diseases in 350-400 families selected by three referral clinical centers involved in the program, by combining next generation sequencing, deep phenotyping and comparison with other similarly affected people all over the world.

Butanol is one of the most promising biofuels due to its superior fuel properties compared to current main biofuels, bioethanol and biodiesel. In addition to its ability to reduce carbon emissions, its higher energy content (almost 30% more than ethanol), its ability to blend with both gasoline and diesel, its lower risk of separation and corrosion, its resistance to water absorption, allowing it to be transported in pipes and carriers used by gasoline, it offers a very exciting advantage for adoption as engines require almost no modifications to use it.    The main WASTE2FUELS innovations include:  •    Development of novel pretreatment methods for converting AFW to an appropriate feedstock for biobutanol production thus dramatically enlarging current available biomass for biofuels production •    Genetically modified microorganisms for enhancing conversion efficiencies of the biobutanol fermentation process •    Coupled recovery and biofilm reactor systems for enhancing conversion efficiencies of Acetone-Butanol-Ethanol fermentation •    Development of new routes for biobutanol production via ethanol catalytic conversion •    Biobutanol engine tests and ecotoxicological assessment of the produced biobutanol •    Valorisation of the process by-products  •    Development of an integrated model to optimise the waste-to-biofuel conversion and facilitate the industrial scale-up •    Process fingerprint analysis by environmental and techno-economic assessment •    Biomass supply chain study and design of a waste management strategy for rural development  By valorising 50% of the unavoidable and undervalorised AFW as feedstock for biobutanol production, WASTE2FUELS could divert up to 45 M tonnes of food waste from EU landfills, preventing 18 M tonnes of GHG and saving almost 0.5 billion litres of fossil fuels.

Although regulation of systemic thyroid status is well understood and underpins treatment of common thyroid disease, it is only in the last decade that the importance of local regulation of thyroid hormone action in tissue development, homeostasis and repair has been identified. During evolution, this complex temporal and cell-specific regulation has been optimized for development and reproductive fitness but NOT for ageing. Humans with their exceptional longevity are thus exposed to a prolonged period of suboptimal local thyroid hormone action. Consistent with this, thyroid status is a continuous variable within the population that is related to fracture risk, muscle mass and cognitive decline. Moreover, in healthy longevity thyroid status is characterized by thyroid stimulating hormone in the upper half of the reference range. In these studies, we will determine how local regulation of thyroid hormone action controls tissue homeostasis and repair, whilst its dysregulation is a common mechanism underlying chronic disease development during ageing. We focus on osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, neurodegeneration and sarcopenia as paradigm age-related, degenerative disorders. Using cutting-edge technology, we will (i) identify thyroid hormone dependent biomarkers for disease susceptibility in bone, cartilage, central nervous system and skeletal muscle, (ii) manipulate cell-specific thyroid hormone action in these tissues and (iii) develop cell-type specific modulators of thyroid hormone action. THYRAGE integrates cross-disciplinary expertise from clinical and basic scientists, endocrinologists, neuroscientists, gerontologists, and industry-based peptide scientists. These studies will identify and validate novel strategies for prevention and treatment of chronic age-related degenerative disease.
100|grant.4850008|EP/N017242/1|Superconducting Spintronics|Superconducting Spintronics|This programme will study the synergy between superconductivity and magnetism which can be engineered in certain devices and use this to demonstrate superconducting spintronics as future computing technology.  In ferromagnetic metals, an internal exchange field generates an imbalance in the number of electrons with up and down spins which means that currents that emerge from ferromagnets into non-magnetic metals carry a net spin in addition to charge. Such spin polarized currents are utilized for logic and sensor applications (for example in hard disk drives), and finding ways to generate and control them is a major goal of spin electronics (spintronics). However, the heat loss from the charge currents used to generate spin currents can be considerable and this is one reason why applications of spintronics, such as integrated memory chips, are presently limited.  In superconductors charge can flow without dissipation but, since the Cooper pairs consist of electrons with antiparallel spins, charge currents cannot carry spin. Further, since Cooper pairs are easily disrupted by magnetism, the coupling of superconductivity and ferromagnetism might appear useless for applications in spintronics. However, during the past few years a series of discoveries have shown that, not only can magnetism and superconductivity be made to cooperate, but in carefully engineered superconductor/magnet systems new functionality can be created in which spin, charge and superconducting phase coherence can work together. By combining these different degrees of freedom a whole new spectrum of recent predictions is waiting to be explored experimentally. Through this ambitious programme we have the chance to transform this array of predictions and discoveries about the interaction between superconductivity and magnetism into a demonstration technology which could eventually be developed as a replacement for large-scale semiconductor-based logic. Our ideas for the proposed field of superconducting spintronics go far beyond the simple ideas of eliminating resistive losses inherent in conventional spin electronic (spintronic) circuits, but instead aim to exploit unique attributes of the superconducting state to control spin currents and spin accumulation.   The programme brings together teams from three different specialties - superconducting devices, high speed spintronics and theory of strong correlations in mesoscopic physics - which will work together to identify and investigate the key underpinning science. This basic science which will emerge from the programme will allow us to understand which of the many predicted effects are viable for long-term development.   The flexibility of a Programme Grant will allow us to work in parallel on all the potential elements and then progressively focus on those that show most promise for demonstrator devices: firstly a memory device which can store data indefinitely but can be switched with ultra-low energy and, secondly, some form of logic device. The latter may be a transistor-like structure or one of the all-spin logic devices proposed for conventional spintronics. The ambition for these superconducting spintronic devices is that they will combine the scalability inherent in conventional spintronics and the high speed and low power offered by superconductors. The risks are such that we may not be able to realise all of these ideas but, by working in parallel on a wide range of different phenomena which couple superconductivity and spin transport, we have a unique opportunity to define a new technology field.

The availability of such models is a powerful instrument in the hands of engineers, physicians and physicists to be used in the development of new technologies for precise definition of the boundaries of these cancers.  Scientists from the biomedical engineering unit at Technical University of Varna are present in this area both at modelling and simulation of computational breast phantoms and x-ray breast imaging techniques. To advance in their research aims and therefore to raise the profile of their researchers and S&T capacity of the host organisation, collaborations with top research institutions from complementary areas of expertise are a requirement. In addition, the touch with world experts in this area is needed in order to have local researchers at host informed about the most current findings in the field and to discuss specific scientific issues that otherwise will not have such a chance.  The main objective of this action is to increase the research and innovation capacity of the host organisation in the field of computational modelling of breast tumours (including cancers with irregular shape) and their use in studies of advanced x-ray breast imaging techniques such as breast tomosynthesis and phase contrast imaging. For this purpose, the project will establish a close and sustainable collaboration platform, in the form of a network of three scientific groups working in the specific domain of modelling and simulations dedicated for studies of x-ray breast imaging techniques. The network will aim to (a) increase the research and innovation capacity of the host organisation, (b) integrate results of ongoing research, (c) facilitate progress beyond the actual individual possibilities, (d) advance the research activities of all partners through a joint and mutually fruitful collaboration.

Structural periodic design is a powerful strategy for lightweight structures achievements while remaining a convenient solution for manufacturing aspects. One of the research targets is the inclusion of vibroacoustic design rules at early stage of products development through the use of periodic media which exhibit proper dynamic filtering effects. In order to understand how periodic concepts can improve the broadband vibroacoustic signatures and performances, the VIPER project will develop and validate tools for the design of global vibroacoustic treatments based on periodic patterns allowing passive control of structural and acoustical paths in layered concepts. Dealing with large scale periodic structural-acoustic concepts involves a multi-scale aspect that needs specific numerical tools. A two scale strategy will be pursued to handle periodicity effects: the meso-scale, related to the cell or the span size, and the macro-scale related to the final structure size. Bridging the cell scale behavior and the vibroacoustic indicators is a challenging issue which will dramatically improve the macro structural design. As the cell topology and constitutive materials are important data, VIPER will consider the combination of different materials and structural arrangements, in which viscoelastic, poroelastic, auxetic materials will play a major role. Finally, this project will also address the lack of perfect periodicity which can be considered both in view of robustness and design analysis of proposed periodicity based concepts. VIPER has a multi-disciplinary character, coupling expertise from material science, vibration and acoustics as well as applied mathematics. It can offer different applications in transports (aeronautics and space, automobile), energy and civil engineering sectors, where vibroacoustic integrity and comfort can be crucial points.

Although most epilepsies are idiopathic, as they do not recognize a specific triggering mechanism or hereditary transmission, about 1-2% of epilepsies are genetically-determined in a Mendelian fashion. Among the latter forms, mutations in KCNQ2 (and more rarely, KCNQ3) genes encoding for voltage-dependent K+ channel subunits cause neonatal epilepsies with wide phenotypic heterogeneity. On the benign end of the spectrum is Benign Familial Neonatal Seizures (BFNS), a rare, autosomal-dominant epilepsy of newborns, characterized by recurrent seizures that begin in the very first days of life and remit after a few weeks or months; BFNS-affected individuals mostly display normal interictal EEG, neuroimaging, and psychomotor development. More recently, KCNQ2 mutations have been described in neonates affected with pharmacoresistant seizures with psychomotor retardation, suppression-burst pattern at the EEG, and distinct neuroradiological features, thus defining a so-called ""KCNQ2 encephalopathy"". The molecular basis for this striking phenotypic heterogeneity is largely unknown. The present research project will pursue two main objective: on one hand, it will expand the range of molecular mechanisms potentially involved in disease pathogenesis to attempt to establish novel correlation between the severity of the disease and the underlying genetic alteration. On the other hand, in genotyped patients with the most severe conditions and in whom a specific defect in channel function is the likely determinant for disease pathogenesis, it will test the novel hypothesis that a KCNQ opener might improve seizure severity and developmental outcome in a clinical setting. The present project will be of interest not only to those patients affected with KCNQ-related epilepsies, but also impact on the large population of pediatric patients suffering from idiopathic epilepsy, for whom optimal pharmacological treatments are still missing."

In the recent years, the number of projects or studies producing very large quantities of sequencing data – analysing microbial communities make-up and their interactions with the environment – has increased. Yet, the depth of analysis done is very superficial and represents an inefficient use of available information and financial resources.  This project aims to address these deficiencies and  will study the change within microbial communities, under various conditions in  cattle guts and impacting probiotic supplement usage, methane production and feed conversion efficiency in cattle. To succeed, we propose to develop faster and more accurate analytic platforms in order to fully utilise the datasets generated. By focusing on better hardware and software platforms, better expertise and training, this project will pave the way for a more optimal usage of metagenomic datasets, thus reducing the number of animals necessary.  This will ensure better and more economic animal welfare.  The Meta-Plat project objective is a mixture of innovative research, focused application and commercial awareness.

It will be delivered through an inter-sectoral and intra-European coordinated PhD programme focused on carbon-efficient design of geotechnical infrastructure. Industry and Research in the construction sector have been investing significantly in recent years to produce innovative low-carbon technologies. However, little innovation has been created in the geo-infrastructure industry, which is lagging behind other construction industry sectors. TERRE aims to close this gap through a network-wide training programme carried out by a close collaboration of eleven Universities and Research Centres and three SMEs. It is structured to provide a balanced combination of fundamental and applied research and will eventually develop operational tools such as software for low-carbon geotechnical design and a Decision Support System for infrastructure project appraisal. The research fellows will be involved in inter-sectoral and intra-European projects via enrolment in 8 ‘Joint-Awards’ and 7 ‘Industrial’ PhDs. The research fellows will be trained in low-carbon design by developing novel design concepts including eco-reinforced geomaterials, ‘engineered’ vegetation, engineered soil-atmosphere interfaces, biofilms, shallow geothermal energy and soil carbon sequestration. Distinctive features of TERRE are the supervision by an inter-sectoral team and the orientation of the research towards technological applications. Training at the Network level includes the development of entrepreneurial skills via a special programme on ‘Pathways to Research Enterprise’ to support the research fellows in establishing and leading spin-out companies after the end of the project.

Many of the solutions to the grand challenges in the geosciences have been led by European scientists – the understanding of stratigraphy (the timing and distribution of layers of sediment on Earth) and the discovery of the concept of plate tectonics being among the most significant. Our ability to monitor the Earth is rapidly evolving through development of new sensor technology, both on- and below-ground and from outer space; we are able to deliver this information with increasing rapidity, integrate it, provide solutions to geological understanding and furnish essential information for decision makers.  Earth science monitoring systems are distributed across Europe and the globe and measure the physico-chemical characteristics of the planet under different geological regimes. EPOS will bring together 24 European nations and combine national Earth science facilities, the associated data and models together with the scientific expertise into one integrated delivery system for the solid Earth. This infrastructure will allow the Earth sciences to achieve a step change in our understanding of the planet; it will enable us to prepare for geo-hazards and to responsibly manage the subsurface for infrastructure development, waste storage and the use of Earth’s resources.  With a European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC) to be located in Rome (Italy), EPOS will provide an opportunity for Europe to maintain world-leading European Earth sciences and will represent a model for pan-European federated infrastructure.

Despite its medical importance, there is, as yet, no effective means to treat this condition. Therefore, an urgent challenge is to discover treatments able to prevent its onset and/or progression. Thyroid hormone (TH) is a major determinant of muscle functions, and thyroid dysfunctions are leading causes of many myopathies. An emerging concept in this field is that TH’s pleiotropic actions can be amplified or attenuated at cell level by the deiodinase enzymes that can increase (D2) or decrease (D3) the active TH concentration regardless of hormone plasma levels. Based on recent published and new preliminary data, our working hypothesis is that “amplification” of TH action/signalling in muscle is critical in determining the accelerated muscle catabolism that causes muscle loss in numerous diseases. On the contrary, attenuation of the TH signal facilitates the proliferation/survival of muscle stem cells and reduces atrophy. Using genetically manipulated mouse models of altered TH metabolism, STARS aims to dissect the role of TH in muscle fibers and stem cells during the wasting processes. The ground-breaking nature of STARS is the possibility of manipulating a local-acting mechanism that determines the tissue concentration of a diffuse endocrine signal (TH), which is a critical determinant of muscle wasting. We will use state-of-the art methodology and recently generated mouse models in the attempt to explore the therapeutic potential of novel mechanisms to lower the TH signature at a specific muscle level. Proof-of-principle studies will be conducted with novel hormone-peptide conjugates for targeted disease prevention and therapy. The results will have cross-disciplinary implications, for the identification of novel potential therapeutic approaches impacting on stem cell biology, tissue metabolism and healthy ageing.
100|grant.3957940|EP/M023869/1|Novel context-based segmentation algorithms for intelligent microscopy|Novel context-based segmentation algorithms for intelligent microscopy|The aim of this proposal is to develop new computer methods to analyse, quantify and understand the information contained in images of cells and tissues obtained using digital microscopy. This will have wide applications in many areas of biomedicine, especially in histopathology, where it can be used to diagnose cancer, predict the potential behaviour of malignant disease, and implement the most suitable form of treatment.  Currently, decisions about histopathological diagnosis rely to a great extent on expert observers and their experience, but this has the disadvantage that the inevitable element of subjectivity in visual observation makes it difficult to reach quantitative or reproducible judgements. In this project we will design 'context-based' imaging programs to help advance automated analysis and diagnosis of cancer. By 'context-based' here we understand the use of data constructs that (1) allow the structure and relations of cells and tissues in biopsy samples to be modelled in a way that enables computer programs to subsequently 'reason' about the image contents, and (2) allow methods of data extraction that are both quantitative and reproducible. This will be achieved by using a spatial logic called Discrete Mereotopology (DM). We already have proof-of-concept software and a peer-reviewed preliminary publication which demonstrate the efficacy of this approach for encoding and querying relations between the biologically-relevant entities (e.g. cell nucleus, tissue layers, staining patterns) and the image segments detected to correspond to them, thereby enabling histologically relevant models (e.g. cells, tissue types and voids) to be formulated that can be operated on at a level that has not been possible before. This is a departure from traditional pixel-based routines, leading to region-based algorithms that are histologically relevant to the range of images and structures that are expected in histological imaging. This logic-based approach to image analysis brings several advantages. Firstly, it provides a robust, rigorous mathematical foundation for software development. Secondly, it allows histological images to be systematically interpreted in terms of histologically-relevant entities, not just pixels. Thirdly, it enables symbolic and automated reasoning programs to be used alongside numerical methods. We will also incorporate immunohistochemical markers to our histologically relevant models. A key innovation in the proposal is the use of DM to explicitly model the histological localisation of molecular markers, which has never been done before. This will allow a rational evaluation of immunohistochemical patterns and subsequent development of histological predictor markers associated with tumour behaviour and outcome, i.e., what patterns are observed in what kinds of neoplasm, where in tissues the markers are expressed, and how characteristic the patterns are to recorded case outcomes. Finally we will develop markers of data quality to label structures according to how well they approach the expected models they represent. In this way indications of 'confidence in the results' can be associated to the models found in microscopy images. So far this feature is not provided by any form of histological imaging. We believe that the approach outlined here is both translational and invaluable in most biological areas using microscopy, where quantitative results are required to make sound evidence-based decisions.

The involvement of many disciplinary analyses ranging up to high levels of fidelity and agile workflow management are considered to be state-of-the-art and starting point for AGILE.   Advanced optimization techniques and strategies will be developed in order to exploit available computing systems and to gain faster convergence to optimal solutions. Surrogates, decomposition, robust design and uncertainties, global-local optimization, mixed fidelity optimization and system-of-system optimization are central fields of research.  Operating the coupled numerical system and interpreting the high fidelity results requires collaboration of heterogeneous specialists. Techniques for collaboration are the second scientific objective of AGILE using the research on optimization techniques as use case. The interactions between humans and the interactions of the design team with the numerical system both are investigated.  Knowledge-enabled information technologies will be developed in order to support the collaboration process constituting the third, outer-most layer of the nested research concept.   Novel technologies are iteratively implemented, tested and enhanced. Use cases are realistic overall aircraft design tasks for conventional, strut-braced, box-wing and BWB configurations.  The project is set up to proof a speed up of 40% for solving realistic MDO problems compared to today’s state-of-the-art. The resulting technologies will be made available; amongst others via an Open MDO Test Suite.  Reduced development costs and reduced time to market will enable a more agile way of collaboration and joint development and experimenting on innovative products.   AGILE pronounces the collaboration of SME, RES and HES in order to contribute to IND-centred virtual extended enterprises.

The consortium includes partners from Italy, United Kingdom, Poland, Germany, the Netherlands, USA. It will develop a probabilistic procedure for assessing short and long-term risks associated with groundwater contamination, air pollution and induced seismicity. The severity of each of these depends strongly on the unexpected enhanced permeability pattern, which may develop as an unwanted by-product of the fracking processes and may become pathway for gas and fluid migration towards underground water reservoirs or the surface. An important part of SHEER will be devoted to monitor and understand how far this enhanced permeability pattern will develop both in space and time. These hazard may be at least partially inter-related as they all depend on this enhanced permeability pattern. Therefore they will be approached from a multi-hazard, multi parameter perspective. SHEER will develop methodologies and procedures to track and model fracture evolution around shale gas exploitation sites and a robust statistically based, multi-parameter methodology to assess environmental impacts and risks across the operational lifecycle of shale gas. The developed methodologies will be applied and tested on a comprehensive database consisting of seismicity, changes of the quality of ground-waters and air, ground deformations, and operational data collected from past case studies. They will be improved by the high quality data SHEER will collect monitoring micro-seismicity, air and groundwater quality and ground deformation in a planned hydraulic fracturing to be carried out by the Polish Oil and Gas Company in Pomerania. Best practices to be applied in Europe to monitor and minimize any environmental impacts will be worked out with the involvement of an advisory group including governmental decisional bodies and private industries.

Towards a philological, literary, and historical approach to Latin papyri|Papyri and LAtin Texts: INsights and Updated Methodologies. Towards a philological, literary, and historical approach to Latin papyri|The aim of PLATINUM is to scrutinize Latin texts on papyrus from several points of view in order to highlight their substantial contribution to our knowledge of innovations in ancient Roman literature, language, history, and society, especially in the multilingual and multicultural contexts of the Eastern part of the Empire between the 1st century B.C. and 8th century A.D. The first phase of the project will consist in assembling, updating and publishing critical editions, in order to present a new and more accurate corpus of Latin papyri on an easily accessible online platform. The second phase will be focused on providing the texts with a specific, pluridisciplinary commentary that gives new insights on Roman culture. Coming mainly from Egypt and other Roman provinces (as well as Herculaneum and Ravenna), Latin papyri deserve more scholarly attention not only from papyrologists and paleographers, but also from scholars of Latin language, as well as intellectual and cultural historians of Rome. Latin papyri, tablets, and ostraka (potsherds) are constantly increasing in number through archaeological discoveries. Because they are so rare, they are even more valuable than the Greek papyri, which have garnered much attention. The Latin papyri have hitherto represented a border-line field of study that has not been fully exploited either by papyrologists or by scholars of Latin literature. Moreover, the obsolete bibliography and the considerable number of unpublished texts make the study of Latin papyri (and bilingual Latin-Greek, Latin-Coptic, Latin-Punic texts) - whether literary (e.g. Cicero, Vergil, law), paraliterary (grammar, medicine, magic), or documentary (letters, official registers, receipts) – a pioneering and challenging task. A more through study will reveal the untapped potential of Latin texts on papyrus for renewing our knowledge of the circulation and reception of Latin language and education, as a cultural engine in Mediterranean societies.

For this reason targeting single genes for therapeutic intervention have failed in the clinic translation. Based on recent studies on the heart and proof of principle experiments in the brain, a hypothesis has been offered that a modified reperfusion subsequent to a prolonged ischemic episode may confer ischemic neuroprotection, a phenomenon termed postconditioning. More interestingly, it has been recently demonstrated that a short occlusion of an arthery is able to protect the brain from a previous harmful ischemic insult, even if the arthery occluded is in a separate, distant district of the body; this phenomenon is known as remote postconditioning. It is reasonable to consider that, when a subliminal ischemic episode is applied in a distal organ after a longer harmful ischemia, several endogenous humoral and neural pathways are recruited both at local level and in the damaged brain so as to give neuroprotection. This evidence allow to hypothesize that remote limb postconditioning shows a general genetic reprogramming at the brain level, useful for saving infarct, that can be affected by circulating miRNAs. Targeting non-coding genes such as microRNAs, which have the capability to regulate large set of evolutionary conserved coding genes, represents the future of gene therapy. Indeed, miRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs involved in gene regulation. Many miRNAs are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and their expression patterns are reflective of underlying physiologic and pathologic processes. This project aims at the characterization of circulating miRNAs released after stroke and at their usefulness as diagnostic and prognostic marker of stroke. Preliminary data produced in our laboratory show that miRNA 103-1 can be considered crucial in the activation of neurodetrimental pathways evoked by stroke. Furthermore, our goal would be to characterize selective miRNAs expression in blood and brain samples after the neuroprotective approach of remote limb postconditioning in order to identify new druggable targets. This research proposal looks toward the characterization of miRNAs strongly modulated after the neuroprotection given by remote postconditioning, in order to clarify how  beneficial  microRNAs work at a molecular level to induce neurobeneficial effect on stroke  compared to those  neurodetrimental  miRNAs released after stroke. We will start from the assumption that miRNAs that are poorly expressed in normal tissues/ blood samples have been found to be highly expressed in stroke samples. To accomplish these aims we will use: 1. A rat model of ischemic stroke to identify miRNAs signature in serum; 2. Bioinformatic opensource analytic algorithms to identify the actual molecular targets of miRNAs identified;  3. An informatic platform to verify the relevance of those miRNAs significantly modulated by stroke and by neuroprotection; it will be validated the overlap between miRNAs expression profiles both in blood and in brain damaged tissues; 4. A cellular model trasfected with miRNAs of interest in order to verify its modulatory effectiveness;  5. AntimiRNA strategies to silence specific miRNAs in order to assess the effect of this novel pharmacological approach on the behaviour and on the recovery of rodents experimentally affected by stroke. For this last aim we expect to setup a pharmacological strategy in which it will be simulated what happens at a molecular level, when rodents subjected to stroke are neuroprotected by the experimental procedure of remote limb postconditioning.
100|grant.6955067|RBSI149BX8|Scientific Philosophy: Avenarius, Petzoldt and the Berlin Group|Scientific Philosophy: Avenarius, Petzoldt and the Berlin Group|The project proposes a history of philosophy research regarding the German speaking area between the 18th and 19th centuries. Objects of the research are Richard Avenarius (1843-96), Joseph Petzoldt (1862-1929) and the Berlin Group. What unites these names is a common path, followed in the name of  scientific philosophy . Avenarius, a philosopher by training, was convinced of the need for a closer dialogue between philosophy and the sciences. This idea stands at the core both of the foundation of the Vierteljahrsschrift für wissenschaftliche Philosophie (1877) and of his main works, Kritik der reinen Erfahrung (1888-90) and Der menschliche Weltbegriff (1891). The peculiar combination of traditional philosophical problems and ideas coming from new sciences,  that is typical of Avenarius' work, had a significant influence on a diverse range of authors   such as Rickert, Husserl or the neopositivists   and gave life to an actual philosophical school: Empiriocriticism. The main exponent of this school was Joseph Petzoldt, an Avenarius' pupil. He continued his master's idea of  scientific philosophy , first with the foundation of the Gesellschaft für positivistische Philosophie (1912), then with the foundation of the Berlin Section of the Internationalen Gesellschaft für empirische Philosophie (1927). The role played by the latter in the constitution of the Berlin Group was analogous to that played by the Ernst Mach Gesellschaft in the constitution of the Vienna Circle. After Petzoldt's death, it was the two principal exponents of the Berlin Group, Hans Reichenbach (1891-1953) and Walter Dubislav (1895-1937), that were elected to the board of the society, changing its name to Gesellschaft für wissenschaftliche Philosophie. There is, therefore, a precise connection that flows from Avenarius to Petzoldt, and from Petzoldt to the Berlin Group. A connection completely unexplored, though, considering the scant regard paid to them over the years. Apart from my own works, there are no specific studies about Avenarius since the first decades of the 19th century. Interest in the Berlin Group has grown appreciably over the past few years, nevertheless, as the figure of Petzoldt has never been examined, neither has the connection between the group and Avenarius' Empiriocriticism. Until now, studies on the group have focused on its main exponents and its relation with Vienna Circle. On the contrary my research aims at finding the historical and philosophical beginnings of the Berlin Group. The general objective of the project is to reconstruct the path going from Avenarius' and Petzoldt's Empiriocriticism to the Berlin Group's Neopositivisms. The first objective is to highlight the role played by Avenarius and Petzoldt in the development of the debate on  scientific philosophy . The second objective is to point out the empiriocritical roots of the Berlin Group, clarifying how the idea of  scientific philosophy  passed from Avenarius, to Petzoldt, and then to the group.  Regarding the methods, the project assigns a prominent role to archival research. Particular attention will be paid to Avenarius' and Petzoldt's vast Nachlässe and to documents that testify the activities both of Petzoldt's Gesellschaften and the Berlin Group. The expected results are: 1) an Italian translation, with introductory essay, of Avenarius' last work, Bemerkungen zum Begriff des Gegenstandes der Psychologie (1894-95), perhaps the clearest example of how Avenarius intended the dialogue between philosophy and science; 2) a monograph on the common project of promoting  scientific philosophy , which is the main element of continuity between the empiriocriticists and the Berlin Group. The scientific impact of the research consists of: 1) supporting a recovery of the studies on Avenarius; 2) bringing to Italy the internationally, recently growing research on the Berlin Group; 3) contributing to the current research with a new historical and philosophical perspective.
100|grant.6955066|RBSI144KXC|Targeted next generation sequencing as integrative tool for prognosis and follow-up of patients with hereditary anemias|Targeted next generation sequencing as integrative tool for prognosis and follow-up of patients with hereditary anemias|The main aim of this proposal is the development of a fast, accurate, reliable and cost effective prognostic tool for Hereditary Anemias (HA) based on targeted-Next Generation Sequencing (t-NGS). HA represent a substantial and highly heterogeneous group of anemias. Although the diagnosis workflow for these conditions is a normal clinical practice, differential diagnosis, classification and patient stratification among HA are often very difficult. Indeed, the variety of unspecific and overlapping syndromic and non-syndromic phenotypes often hampers a correct clinical management of the patients. Beyond to achieve a definitive diagnosis, knowing the genetic basis of patients  HA can be valuable also for guiding treatment. We plan to create a t-NGS-based method, named  t-ngS as Prognostic tool for HEReditary Anemias  (SPHERA), which can provide a global vision of genetic background of specific subgroups of HA patients. Particularly, SPHERA design will allow identifying modifier variants that could be responsible of an improvement or a worsening of the clinical phenotype associated to HA. We aim to obtain a catalogue of phenotype-modifier variants in patients selected among families with different HA, representative of almost two different pathogenetic mechanisms: (i) hyporegenerative anemias as a model of ineffective erythropoiesis; (ii) hemolytic anemias due to red cell membrane defects. T-NGS will include coding regions, splicing sites, and regulatory regions of a suite of genes relevant for hematological disorders. Particularly, we will select as modifiers genes codifying for proteins involved in at least three different biological processes: (i) iron metabolism; (ii) heme biosynthesis and degradation; (iii) regulation of erythropoiesis. The development of SPHERA design for the parallel analysis of several modifier genes and, consequently, the development of algorithms for personalized medicine will provide significant impact on patients  follow-up and management, leading to improved clinical decisions and health outcomes. Moreover, discovery of the genetic basis of a large collection of rare disorders will lead us to expand our understanding of the biology of hereditary anemias, facilitate accurate diagnosis and improved management, and provide initiative for further investigation of new therapeutics. Finally, high-throughput analysis of different clusters of HA will allow a characterization of modifiers mutations of specific anemia subgroups.
100|grant.6955064|RBSI149484|Themodynamics in vitreoretinal surgery|Themodynamics in vitreoretinal surgery|"The project has as its primary purpose the development of a device able to heat and cool the flow of infusion, liquid and gaseous, during vitrectomy in order to perform a  vitrectomy under temperature control . The project also aims to perform, in vivo, a prospective randomized clinical trial conducted in patients suffering from vitreo-retinal deseases in order to measure the effects of temperature changes during vitreoretinal surgery.  Changes in viscosity and vapor pressure of the vitreous substitutes used in vitreoretinal surgery will also be evaluated. The application of mild to moderate hypothermia, with temperatures between 32-35 ° C, has demonstrated neuroprotective efficacy in patients exposed to ischemia-reperfusion damage during the neurosurgery. The hypothermia is able (i) to block the inflammatory cascade that results in cell apoptosis with destruction of the blood-retinal barrier, (ii) to reduce the consumption of oxygen, (iii) to stimulate the release of neuroprotective proteins. This method is the current application in the treatment of neonatal encephalopathy, in cardiac and neurosurgery. It has been also reported that the profound hypothermia (temperature less than 32 ° C) is associated with a decrease in the concentration of thromboxane B2, platelet inhibition, increased risk of infection and electrolyte imbalance. Although significant changes in temperature have been reported during the vitrectomy surgery, iatrogenioc damage induced by the fluctuation in temperature is never been taken into account. We recently described large fluctuations in temperature of the surface of the retina and vitreous cavity during the vitrectomy. The temperatures were continuously recorded during all phases of vitrectomy reaching deep hypothermia [24.8 ° C (SD 0.8 ° C)] in the final stages of the surgery. Temperature fluctuations observed were statistically significant. Such fluctuations of the temperature within the vitreous cavity, until the hypothermia in the phases of inflow and outflow-on-on, may influence the functional recovery and the final result of the surgery. From the structural point of view the vitreous body is a natural composite formed by a viscoelastic matrix of macromolecules of hyaluronic acid highly hydrated reinforced by a network of rigid fibrils of collagen insoluble in water and responsible for the formation of the vitreous gel. The viscoelastic behavior, typical of the ""weak gels"", is rheologically monitored by measuring the elastic modulus, G ', and viscous, G''. Perfluorocarbon liquid (PFCL) is injected on the retina in order to keep the retina attached during the surgery. PFCL in highly inflammatory compound and it must be removed at the end of the intervention. However, such a removal, with the technique currently used, is not total, and it can give rise to emulsions causing serious sides effects such as glaucoma, proliferative vitreo-retinopathy etc. Such emulsions are the result of interaction that is created into the vitreous cavity between substances in different density, viscosity, and rheology. Moreover, the high viscosity of the vitreous substitutes and their viscoelasticity, in the presence of thermal gradients occurring during the operation, do not allow a complete filling of the same vitreous cavity. Consequently, the aqueous humor produced by the eye fills all the gaps generating highly unstable emulsions. Experimental measurements will be conducted to assess the dynamic characteristics and rheological properties of perfluorocarbon liquid and vitreous substitutes, as the temperature changes. The emulsifying capacity of the individual substances will be tested in vitro by dynamic light scattering and fluorescence. Finally, studies will be performed to determine the appropriate formulations to obtain a buffering system easy to remove (with lesser interfacial tension) and with minimal formation of emulsions."

Most epilepsies are idiopathic, as they do not recognize a specific triggering mechanism or hereditary transmission, although a strong genetic component is suspected. Among genetically-determined epilepsies, mutations in KCNQ2, and more rarely KCNQ3 genes, have been identified in patients with Benign Familial Neonatal Seizures (BFNS), a rare autosomal-dominant epilepsy of the newborn with mostly benign neurodevelopmental outcome. More recently, KCNQ2 mutations have been also described in neonates affected with Early Onset Epileptic Encephalopathies (EOEEs), a group of devastating epilepsies characterized by refractory seizures and cognitive arrest or regression that typically carry a poor prognosis. KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 genes belong to KCNQ family that comprise five members (KCNQ1 to KCNQ5) encoding for voltage-gated potassium channel subunits with distinct expression pattern and physiological roles. Heterotetramerization of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 subunits is thought to underlie most of the M-current, a K+ current that regulates neuronal excitability in the sub-threshold range for action potential generation. KCNQ channels are tetramers of subunits, each showing six transmembrane segments (S1-S6) and cytoplasmic N- and C-termini; the S5-S6 region forms the wall of pore domain, while S1-S4 is the Voltage-Sensing Domain (VSD). Most disease-causing mutations cluster in the long C-terminus, in pore region, or in the VSD. The main pathogenetic hypothesis to explain epilepsy occurrence in individuals with familial or sporadic KCNQ2/3 mutations is a loss-of-function in the K+ current underlined by KCNQ2/3 channels, possibly leading to a reduction in the repolarizing reserve of excitatory neurons which would trigger neuronal hyperexcitability. Our preliminary data suggest that, at least some KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 mutations, increase rather than decrease the voltage-dependent opening probability, suggesting that, in addition to a loss-of-function, a gain-of-function mechanism might also contribute to disease pathogenesis. In the present Research project we propose: 1. to better define the pathophysiological mechanism by which KCNQ2/3 channel mutations cause the described heterogeneity in the clinical presentation of KCNQ2 mutations, in order to establish genotype-phenotype correlations; 2. to define the possible trajectories of each helix in the VSD during KCNQ2/3 channel gating; and 3. to develop novel subtype-selective KCNQ activators which might be useful for treating hyperexcitability diseases including epilepsy.  To achieve theses aims, we propose to study the functional properties of KCNQ2/3 mutations causing EOEE by biochemical, electrophysiological, and optical techniques in various heterologous expression systems, including Xenopus oocytes, non-neuronal and neuronal mammalian cells. We will also generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from somatic cells of patients carrying the relevant KCNQ2/3 mutations. The structural mechanism by which each specific mutation disturbs VSD repositioning will be studied by means of gating current and voltage-clamp fluorometric recordings, and the results implemented into a structural model using a novel multistate strategy. Finally, as KCNQ2/3 channels are emerging targets for the treatment of several human hyperexcitability diseases, we aim to develop novel experimental tools to identify and characterize subtype-selective modulators of neuronal KCNQ channels. Successful achievement of the proposed aims will improve diagnostic and prognostic tools currently available for neonatal epilepsies, and will set the basis for the discovery of safer and more effective drugs, a compelling need for such critical patient population.

At the chronological boundaries of this period, two key moments in the history of Italian culture are to be found: the production of the first literary texts in Italo-Romance varieties and the development of Humanism. Latin played a fundamental role in the historical development of European literary culture.  European literatures unavoidably developed their own canons and traditions vis-à-vis Latin models, whether they (partially) rejected or fully accepted them. It is generally maintained that Latin models strongly influenced the syntax and style of Italian writers in the Middle Ages and that the Latin models they followed changed over time: while in the 13th century, and partially in the 14th century, Italian writers mainly used models that could be traced back to the language and style of the authors of late Antiquity, 15th-century humanists were confronted more directly with Classical Latin authors. Nonetheless these assumptions have never been supported by a comprehensive study of specific syntactic and textual patterns in Latin and Italo-Romance texts. A study of selected syntactic and textual structures within a large corpus of Latin and Italo-Romance texts could significantly enhance our understanding of the cultural dynamics in the transition from Medieval to early humanistic models.  This multidisciplinary project will focus on three syntactic patterns (complement clauses, absolute constructions and hypotaxis) in both Latin and Italo-Romance texts, and analyse them employing a functional-typological methodology, in which the impact of semantic and pragmatic factors over syntax and textuality (and more generally the interactions between these different levels of analysis) plays a crucial role. Each text will be interpreted in the light of the literary, social and cultural environment in which it was produced. Given the nature of the project, the team is made up of specialists from different fields: general linguistics, Latin linguistics, Italian linguistics, medieval history, and Italian and Latin medieval literature. Particular attention will be paid to the selection of the texts: the corpus will be established after a two-month collective discussion which will chiefly consider aspects of textual typology, and diatopic variation. The analysis will be conducted on works of the same textual typology, involving two separate corpora of literary and non-literary texts: an Italo-Romance corpus and a Latin corpus. The former will consist of texts written between the 13th and 15th centuries and will contain both translations from Latin and original texts. The latter will consist of two sub-groups: 1) texts written between the 1st century BC and the 6th century AD; and 2) texts written in Italy between the 13th and 15th centuries. The parallel analysis of syntactic (and textual) structures represents a reliable diagnostic tool that will enable us to establish the main models used by Italian authors in the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries. This study will shed light on a key research question:  To what extent did the cultural changes that occurred in the period under consideration affect the influence of Latin on the syntax of texts written in Italo-Romance varieties?  This question tackles one of the most debated issues in theoretical linguistics, i.e. the relationship between external and internal factors in language variation and change. Furthermore, the methodology developed for this project will be a useful tool for further investigations of other Romance languages, and for studies of cultural matters at the interface between history and linguistics. Finally, this research will also provide an open-access, annotated online database containing the data collected during the study. This database will facilitate further syntactic and textual studies on both Latin and Italo-Romance texts.

Roal aims at providing a reliable connection already at the physical layer, thus  relaxing the need for additional protection schemes at higher layers. The objectives of Roal include the development of tools and methods for implementing serial interconnections robust to soft-errors, which are typical in radiation environments, such as on-detector trigger and data acquisition (TDAQ) electronics for Nuclear and Sub-nuclear Physics experiments.  Roal links (Ro-Links for short) will support specific features to enable deterministic latency transmission, a feature usually needed in TDAQ systems. Ro-Links will merge data, trigger, fast control transfers and timing messages in the same physical channel in order to minimize the cabling between the elements of the system.  A technology today available and useful for the objectives of the proposal, consists in latest-generation SRAM-based FPGAs, which include high-speed serial IOs (5-13Gbps), offer wide processing capabilities and are reconfigurable on field, even while operating. In fact, SRAM-based FPGAs are already used for the abovementioned applications, but only in specific radiation-free regions. This limitation is due to their sensitivity to configuration  single event upsets (SEUs) or multiple bit upsets (MBUs), which might alter the design functionality. The development carried out  in this project aims at deploying FPGAs also in areas with radiation, within certain limits, opening the way to a better integration of the electronics.  One of the objectives of the proposal is developing a method for real-time detection and correction of multiple errors in configurable logic devices (such as SRAM-based FPGAs), which would solve the limitations of the present state of art. This self-repair method shall limit the accumulation of SEUs in the device configuration, without requiring dedicated radiation-hardened  memories, and  it shall permit to correct a higher percentage of errors. Ro-Links will also monitor the configuration error rate, thus providing a real-time dosimetry and they will use this information to adjust the error detection and correction frequency accordingly. The error rate measurement can be also used to enhance or soften forward error correction (FEC) parameters adaptively, in such a way to automatically determine a valid data-rate versus bit error ratio trade-off. This error detection and correction method will be developed for protecting general purpose designs  implemented in programmable devices sensitive to radiation, it will not be limited to the protection of high-speed serial links. Another major objective of the project is the implementation of a dedicated demonstrator of the proposed links. In addition to the implementation of the Roal architecture on FPGAs, the demonstrator will require an electronic board-set, specifically designed within the project. The boards will permit to verify in hardware specific design choices for the links in different operating conditions, they will support dedicated IOs for fault injection and detection, they will include the possibility of plugging-in opto-electronic transceivers for transmissions on fibers and they will be designed having in mind the usage in irradiation tests. A test bed will be used in order to verify and characterize the demonstrator in terms of its logical and physical parameters.  Despite a specific technology has necessarily to be chosen for realizing a demonstrator, the Roal architecture and the self-repair method will be developed to be independent of the specific device implementing the reconfigurable hardware. On one hand, this favors the integration in multiple applications and on the other hand, it stretches the life-cycle, by making it possible to re-use the system on newer hardware as soon as it becomes available.
100|grant.6954952|RBSI143JZM|Target therapy for aggressive pituitary tumors and pituitary carcinomas|Target therapy for aggressive pituitary tumors and pituitary carcinomas|The vast majority of pituitary tumors are non-invasive, benign, slow growing lesions, but some might require careful follow-up: local invasion is reported in up to 40% of surgically treated pituitary adenomas, resistance to medical treatment or recurrence leading to multi-modal therapy is not unusual, and the time between surgery and recurrence can be short because of a high proliferation rate. Such tumors may correspond to  atypical adenomas  as defined by the World Health Organization classification, mainly characterized by invasive growth, elevated mitotic index, Ki-67 labelling index >3 % and extensive nuclear reactivity for p53. Conversely carcinomas, accounting for less than 1% of all pituitary tumors, can result in distant metastases. Prognosis is poor since both aggressive tumors and carcinomas commonly relapse after radical surgical excision with a scarce responsiveness to radiotherapy or chemotherapy, with specific target treatments being still lacking. Recent evidence has documented the successful use of temozolomide, an alkylating chemotherapeutic agent, in the management of aggressive pituitary tumors and carcinomas, with greater efficacy (up to 60%) being reported in aggressive PRL and ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors. To date, in Italy temozolomide is the only medical therapy approved for the treatment of patients with aggressive pituitary tumors and pituitary carcinomas. The current study aims 1. at identifying in vitro early molecular markers of responsiveness to target therapies, including temozolomide, pasireotide, everolimus and bevacizumab administered as monotherapy (temozolomide, pasireotide) or as combined treatment (pasireotide plus everolimus, or pasireotide plus bevacizumab), and 2. at prospectively investigating in vivo efficacy and safety of 12-month treatment with such innovative therapeutic strategies in a cohort of patients with aggressive pituitary tumors and pituitary carcinomas, also correlating in vitro results with in vivo response to treatment. For the purpose of the study, in both paraffin embedded tissues and in primary cultures from surgically removed pituitary tumors, protein and mRNA expression of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) subtypes 2, 3 and 5, as well as of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway components p70S6K and PTEN, and VEGF-A and VEGF1 (Flt-1) and VEGF2 (Flk-1) receptors will be respectively assessed. Moreover, the expression of truncated variants of subtype 5 somatostatin receptor, TMD5 and TMD4, as well as of β-Arrestins 1 and 2 and GRK2 will be evaluated to investigate their role as potential mechanisms of resistance to conventional medical therapy. In vivo effects of temozolomide, pasireotide, everolimus and bevacizumab, administered for 12 months as monotherapy or as combined treatment, will be evaluated in a multicentre, international, open label, randomized, multiple arms, two-step, prospective study in a cohort of at least 50 patients with aggressive pituitary tumors and pituitary carcinoma. At the study entry, patients will be randomly assigned to treatment with temozolomide (Arm A, control group) or pasireotide (Arm B). Primary endpoints of both treatments will include: suppression of hormonal secretion ≥ 50% of baseline values (only for patients with secreting tumors), and tumor shrinkage ≥ 25% of baseline volume (for all patients). Monthly follow up visits will take place, and diagnostic procedures will include imaging, biochemistry and hormonal assessment. After 3 months of treatment with pasireotide, patients not achieving primary endpoints will be randomly assigned to combined treatment with bevacizumab (Arm C1) or everolimus (Arm C2).  Patients will be monthly followed up until last study visit after 12 months of medical therapy

Wnt ligand stimulation of Fzd receptors activates the Wnt signalling pathway. Although Wnt signalling is known to play a crucial role in a variety of processes (such as proliferation, differentiation and regeneration), specific functions of each Wnt ligands and receptors remain still poorly characterized. Indeed, redundancy and early phenotypes in the embryo represent an important limitation for the use of single knock-out models by masking important phenotypes. Importantly, autocrine/paracrine Wnt signalling is essential for the identity of several stem cell types such as embryonic stem cells, neural progenitors, intestinal stem cells and epidermal stem cells. Our previous data indicate that different subsets of Wnt ligands/receptors are specifically expressed depending on culture conditions in embryonic stem cells (Aloia et al., Genes&Development, 2014), suggesting that Wnt factors exert non-overlapping functions. To investigate the function of Wnt ligands/receptors we will take advantage from a new technology, the so-called Crispr/Cas9. This technology allows multiple genome editing with high efficiency and in a reasonable time frame. By using the Crispr/Cas9 technology we will perform a systemic study to elucidate the function of the 19 Wnt ligands and of the 11 Fzd receptors described in mammals. First, we will perform a detailed analysis of the expression of single Wnt ligands/ receptors in the embryo at different developmental stages and in the adult in several tissues and organs. Once obtained these data, we will perform conditional genome editing of multiple Wnt ligands/Fzd receptors in mouse embryonic stem cells and will investigate the role of the genes mentioned in self-renewal and differentiation. The most interesting factors will be tested for their role in vivo by injecting into zygotes the same constructs used for genome editing in embryonic stem cells . Multiple genome editing and conditional depletion of gene expression should allow us to overcome redundancy and lack of phenotypes due to early developmental defects. In addition, we will generate neural progenitor cells from embryonic stem cells and will test their capacity of differentiation into neurons in vitro and in vivo. With these approaches we will unveil specific function for Wnt ligands/receptors in development and neurogenesis. Finally we will also identify the target genes of Wnt activity and investigate the regulation of the expression of Wnt ligands/Fzd receptors. For these analyses, we will take advantage of powerful and sensitive techniques such as RNA-sequencing and ChIP-sequencing that allow genome-wide studies.  Therefore, we set out to understand the molecular mechanisms of the Wnt activity in different physiological contexts. Given the role of Wnt signalling in maintenance of stem cells, the data generated will elucidate new mechanisms involved in the complex regulation of stem cell homeostasis. In line with this, our data could be useful for regenerative medicine in a large variety of tissues and organs, where Wnt activity play a crucial role. In particular, we will focus on the role of Wnt factors in neurogenesis. Our ultimate goal will be to suggest combination of Wnt ligands/receptors as target for regenerative medicine in neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, since mis-regulation of Wnt signalling has been reported to play a role in several cancer and diseases, our data could be useful to develop new therapeutic strategies in these contexts. In particular we believe that extensive knowledge of coordinated expression of Wnt ligands/receptors is required to rescue correct expression of Wnt factors and in turn, proper Wnt activity in cancer and diseases.
100|grant.6859677|2015HPMLFY|Thyroid cancer and cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules|Thyroid cancer and cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules|BACKGROUND: In the last decade the number of thyroidectomies (TX) in Italy has increased up to 40.000/year following the great increase of incidence of thyroid cancer (TC). Since about 50% of the increased TC is due to papillary microcarcinomas (mPTC) (<1cm), it appears that a significantly increased detection of subclinical disease is the factor driving this rise. Moreover, another big group of patients who until now have been blindly submitted to TX are patients with a cytologically “indeterminate” (TIR3) thyroid nodule but nowadays it is recognized that the majority of these nodules are benign or if malignant are low risk cancers.  AIM of this project is to collect epidemiological, clinical, biochemical, echographic and molecular data of patients with mPTC or TIR3 who will accept the alternative strategy of an active surveillance. Those who will prefer to be submitted to TX will represent the control group. In this group also histological and immunohistochemical data will be acquired.   METHODS: 12 Units will participate by enrolling patients from different regions of Italy in two arms: those who will choose the active surveillance and those who will undergo TX. Clinical, epidemiological, echographic, biochemical, and molecular data will be collected homogeneously by sharing the same electronic database as well as a neck ultrasound form to be filled up and, in the case of patients submitted to TX, also a common form for the pathological report. After 2 years of enrolment, data will be retrieved at the Coordinator’s Unit for the descriptive and statistical analysis. In the same framework, some Units will perform individual subprojects to find other possible features able to predict the aggressiveness and the outcome of patients enrolled in the two groups. In particular the following analysis will be performed in the local enrolled cases: a)mRNA and miRNA differential expression profiles; b)Immunological characterization of the microenvironment; c)Circulating miRNA evaluation; d)Circulating free tumoral DNA measurement; e)Long noncoding RNAs expression; f)Histone modifications as epigenetic mechanisms of gene expression regulation; g)Cellular composition of tumor microenvironment; h)Characterization of TgAb epitopes. Results of interest will be expanded using the samples collected in the other Units.  EXPECTED RESULTS: to find features that could predict the aggressiveness and the outcome of theses thyroid diseases and identify those cases that better require an immediate surgical treatment from those who can be followed up without significant consequences for the patient health.  IMPACT OF THE PROJECT: a better definition of cancer risk will allow a more precise patient tailored medicine. This will result in a significant social and economical impact through the reduction of TX but maintaining a high standard of care of patients not submitted to TX. Moreover, a precise and tailored medicine will be much more appreciated by patients.

Study of biochemical aspects, chemical reactivity and sensory characteristics for developing precision and sustainable enological models from vineyard to consumer|The diversity of tannins in Italian red wines. Study of biochemical aspects, chemical reactivity and sensory characteristics for developing precision and sustainable enological models from vineyard to consumer|The tannins of grape berry skins and seeds are important constituents of red wine, contributing to its color, mouthfeel and aroma longevity. During winemaking, grape tannins are extracted into the wine where they come in contact with other metabolites, their chemical structure being modified through a network of reactions with other grape and wine components. The combination of grape native and newly formed tannins contribute to the mouthfeel properties of the wine. Among these, astringency, namely the trigeminal sensation of friction perceived during wine tasting, is key to red wine perceived quality. While certain wines exhibit pleasant silky and velvety astringency, others provides less pleasant sensations of drying/puckering astringency as well as bitterness, potentially driving consumers’ rejection. The chemical nature of the species involved in these different astringent and bitter characteristics is in large part unknown. The potential for other wine components to modulate red wine astringency perception (eg polysaccharides, proteins, and aroma compounds), is also not fully understood. In addition, the ability of tannins to influence wine aroma development during ageing should be investigated.   With over three-hundred grape varieties, Italy owns one of the richest ampelographic heritages worldwide. Among these grapes, several examples of varieties extremely rich in tannins exist, so that the wines obtained from these grapes should be characterized by extreme astringency, with potentially negative commercial outcomes. Nevertheless, these high tannin grapes includes Nebbiolo, Sagrantino, or Aglianico, often exhibiting pleasant velvety astringency and representing some of the best examples of Italian red wines. The reasons of this apparent paradox are not known.  The aim of this project is to provide, by means of transcriptional, chemical and sensory approaches, a full description of the diversity existing among Italian grapes and wines with regard to their tannins, in particular their biosynthesis, chemical composition, reactivity with other compounds including aromas, polysaccharides and proteins, as well as sensory properties. The ultimate goal is to generate, for different Italian red grapes and wines, a database of   1)   transcriptomic data about grape tannin biosynthesis   2) compositional information about tannin fraction ability to react with other relevant components (eg. wine aroma, proteins, polysaccharides compounds; salivary proteins)  3)  astringency characteristics of individual grape and wine types, including a specific sensory vocabulary for italian grapes and wines  Such database will allow novel knowledge on the factors involved in the perception of astringency, identification and characterization of potential technological role of tannins, development of novel viticultural and winemaking approaches for improved management of wine tannin, and communication about the sensory specificity and uniqueness of Italian red wine

Il tema – al centro di un vasto dibattito e oggetto di un’ampia e assai eclettica letteratura – sarà affrontato lungo tre direttrici fondamentali: 1) un’analisi storico-genealogica della sovranità, delle pratiche governamentali e dei meccanismi di governance tra età moderna ed età globale; 2) una ricognizione delle principali forme che hanno assunto oggi, nell’era globale, i processi e le procedure del governo degli uomini, con speciale riguardo ai dispositivi di governance nel loro rapporto con la sfera tradizionale della sovranità statuale a livello locale, nazionale, europeo e globale; 3) una riflessione critica sull’impatto di tali processi e procedure sulla rappresentanza politica e sulla democrazia. Gli strumenti metodologici cui la ricerca farà riferimento nel suo articolato sviluppo saranno soprattutto quelli dei governmentality studies, della storia dei concetti, della «storia atlantica», degli «studi post-coloniali», della cosiddetta «storia intellettuale globale», nonché dell’analisi politologica e giuridica. Per la pluralità e la complessità dei fenomeni con cui dovrà confrontarsi, la ricerca è affidata a un ampio network di studiosi che provengono in misura prevalente (ma non esclusiva) dal campo della filosofia politica e della storia del pensiero politico. È convinzione dei proponenti che le peculiari prospettive di queste discipline e gli strumenti metodologici e categoriali che sono loro propri possano aggiungere un importante e originale punto di vista alle riflessioni che intorno agli stessi temi stanno impegnando ormai da diversi anni le scienze politiche e sociali, giuridiche ed economiche. La ricerca interagirà sistematicamente con queste discipline, ma con un approccio che – si ritiene – potrà avere un significativo valore aggiunto rispetto all’attuale stato dell’arte in materia. In tal senso, si attendono risultati rilevanti. Non soltanto sul piano più propriamente teorico-scientifico e della conoscenza, ma anche, e più in generale, sul terreno di un dibattito pubblico che possa coinvolgere a più livelli istituzioni, gruppi politici, associazioni e organizzazioni della società civile.

Recenti esperimenti, in cui per la prima volta  effetti gravitazionali sono stati misurati con alta precisione tramite  sensori quantistici  basati su atomi ultrafreddi, aprono nuove affascinanti prospettive per la ricerca sperimentale e teorica.    Obiettivo del progetto è lo sviluppo di un interferometro atomico (IA) avanzato come sensore quantistico per esperimenti di fisica gravitazionale. In particolare si intende studiare schemi innovativi basati su ""entanglement"" quantistico e aumentare di ordini di grandezza la sensibilità di rivelazione mediante l'uso di sorgenti atomiche ""squeezed"". L'attività sperimentale e teorica per lo sviluppo della sorgente atomica squeezed e la sua integrazione in un IA sarà svolta in sinergia con lo studio teorico sulle prospettive di nuovi esperimenti sia di tipo fondamentale che applicativo, resi possibili dalle eccezionali caratteristiche di sensibilità ed accuratezza che ci si aspetta di raggiungere.    Oltre all'interesse nella fisica fondamentale per la possibilità di effettuare nuovi esperimenti sulla gravità con sistemi quantistici, il progetto ha importanti ricadute applicative legate alla rivelazione con elevata sensibilità e con misure in continua di variazioni del campo gravitazionale prodotte, per esempio, da movimenti di masse all'interno dei vulcani.   Il progetto è quindi caratterizzato da forte interdisciplinarità, collegando settori quali la meccanica quantistica, la fisica della gravitazione e della relatività generale, la geofisica.    Tali possibilità verranno studiate con un approccio interdisciplinare reso possibile dalla composizione del team proponente.  E' da notare l'importanza della collaborazione tra esperti di relatività generale e geofisici: gli stessi effetti che in un ambito sono considerati un rumore, nell'altro possono costituire un segnale; un esempio è il ""rumore"" Newtoniano. La forte integrazione tra i due campi ha precedenti illustri: Einstein stesso si interessò alla geofisica e diede importanti contributi [W. Schroder, H.-J. Treder, ""Einstein and Geophysics: Valuable Contributions Warrant a Second Look"", EOS, 78, 43 (1997)].    Con riferimento alle guidelines di Horizon 2020, il progetto afferisce principalmente all’ambito “Excellent Science” (I-2.3 “FET Flagships: tackling grand interdisciplinary science and technology challenges”), ma interessa anche l’ambito “Societal Challenges” (III-6.3. “Secure Societies” per lo sviluppo di tecnologie di monitoraggio a supporto delle procedure di mitigazione dei rischi connessi a calamità naturali, quali eruzioni vulcaniche e terremoti), coinvolgendo quindi settori ERC PE (Physical Science and Engineering, in particolare 9 e 10) ed SH (Social Sciences and Humanities, in particolare 3)."

Ad oggi, il GBM è la più aggressiva fra le neoplasie del sistema nervoso centrale, con una sopravvivenza a 5 anni dalla diagnosi di solo il 5%. I più moderni approcci di chirurgia, radioterapia e chemio-terapia che prevedeno l’utilizzo in massima parte di temozolomide (TMZ) e bevacizumab, portano solo un limitato aumento della sopravvivenza. Recentemente diversi dati dell’FDA dimostrano che l’approccio farmacologico multi-target determina un maggiore successo terapeutico rispetto all’impiego di agenti a singolo target. Alla luce di queste evidenze il progetto prevede la progettazione, sintesi e sperimentazione biologica di nuove molecole capaci di agire sinergicamente su specifici pathway alterati nel GBM. In particolare si prevede lo sviluppo di attivatori diretti della proteina pro-apoptotica BAX, quali analoghi del lead da noi ritrovato (BA-8), attraverso calcoli di Free Energy Perturbation (FEP) e di re-coring, ed attraverso classici studi di relazione struttura–attività. Inoltre si cercherà di ripristinare la funzionalità di p53 tramite lo sviluppo di nuovi antagonisti dei suoi inibitori specifici MDM-2/4; in particolare dal momento che gli antagonisti selettivi di MDM-2 non risultano efficaci in tumori che esprimono anche elevati livelli di MDM-4, si intende progettare nuovi inibitori duali partendo da lead da noi sviluppati attivi sulla sola MDM-2. Tali inibitori saranno sviluppati anche a partire da LM-8, un ligando da noi recentemente scoperto in grado di interagire con MDM-2 e MDM-4, e allo stesso tempo inibire l’integrina α5β1, strettamente coinvolta nello sopravvivenza/sviluppo di GBM. I dati ottenuti permetteranno la progettazione di analoghi di LM-8 capaci di agire simultaneamente sui tre target con una migliore affinità. Infine, verranno sintetizzati nuovi derivati ariltioindolici (ATI) e 3-aroil-1,4-diarilpyrrolici (ARDAP) come inibitori della polimerizzazione della tubulina, utilizzando procedure in grado di fornire alte rese in tempi ridotti. Le affinità dei composti di nuova sintesi nei confronti di ogni target saranno determinate tramite dosaggi immunoenzimatici specifici (MDM2/4, integrina α5β1) o saggi spettrofotometrici (tubulina).  I nuovi composti saranno saggiati in cellule di GBM umano per il loro potenziale anti-proliferativo, l'induzione della dissipazione del potenziale di membrana e la capacità di generare specie reattive dell’ossigeno. Verranno inoltre isolate dal GBM le cellule staminali cancerose  responsabili di fenomeni di chemioresistenza e recidiva, e composti selezionati saranno saggiati per il loro potenziale pro-differenziante. La combinazione di tecnologie di progettazione razionale in silico, metodi sintetici avanzati ed una accurata caratterizzazione biologica porterà un forte avanzamento delle conoscenze sul trattamento del GBM.

Industrialized countries spend approximately 3% of their annual sanitary costs for rehabilitation and long-term hospice care of stroke patients. Given the significant socio-economic impact also due to the limitations of the currently available therapies, the validation of endogenous neuroprotection induced by ischemic preconditioning is considered a novel perspective in stroke therapy. Although both neuronal pathways and immune mediators have been suggested to be triggered by ischemic preconditioning, the cascade of events leading to neuronal tolerance has not been completely elucidated. Ca2+ dysregulation, occurring in hypoxic neurons, is significantly recovered by a generic Ca2+ refilling into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thus delaying apoptosis. Therefore, we hypothesized that the activation of store-operated calcium (SOC) mediated by the interaction between STIM1, an ER-located Ca2+ sensor, and the Ca2+ selective plasmamembrane channel ORAI1 may promote cell tolerance in ischemic preconditioning. On the other hand, in immune cells, SOC-mediated Ca2+ entry is a major mechanism regulating critical immune functions. We hypothesize that ORAI1/STIM1 interaction and SOC activation may be involved in the reprogramming and polarization of immune reactions during ischemic preconditioning, thus supporting ischemic tolerance. We suggest that the combination of preconditioning-induced tolerance in neurons and reprogramming the innate immune system -through the modulation of SOCs - may represent a novel strategy to induce neuroprotection. This multi-target approach, aimed at modulating both neurons and immune cells, will allow to increase the efficacy of the therapeutic intervention with neuroprotective or immunomodulatory drugs, consisting in targeting one single mechanism. On the other hand, pH imbalance occurring during stroke, may act as an upstream mechanism regulating ER Ca2+ homeostasis through SOC modulation. In fact, acidification of the extracellular milieu- that commonly occurs during hypoxia- strongly inhibits SOCs in neurons and also in macrophages. Carbonic anhydrases are key regulators of pH, thus representing attractive SOC partners in ischemic tolerance. Therefore, we hypothesize that dysregulation of carbonic anhydrase activities may underlie altered ER Ca2+ refilling through SOCs. By an integrated approach consisting on the use of genetic and pharmacological tools, we will characterize the net contribution of ORAI1, STIM1 and selected  members of carbonic anhydrase family to preconditioning-induced tolerance in neurons and to detrimental vs reparative polarization shifts of macrophage and neutrophil. In fact, if successful, this proposal will provide knowledge on the role of ORAI1, STIM1 and their partners in ischemic preconditioning thus leading to the identification of: 1)new druggable targets and 2)new stroke prognostic/diagnostic markers.

This source, and associated imaging detectors, dosimeters and software simulation tools, has unique properties of temporal resolution, spatial resolution and spatial coherence, featuring a table-top structure which provides compatibility with a clinical environment as found in hospital-based preclinical facilities.    Due to the widespread use of animal models for the preclinical study of human diseases and drug development, dedicated tools have been developed for both high-resolution imaging and high-dose rate irradiation on small living subjects. X-ray based techniques play a prominent role on the above-mentioned domains, as demonstrated by the growing number of micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) scanners (Badea et al, Phys Med Biol 2008; 53:R319-50) as well as the recent spread of several prototypes of small animal radiation therapy (RT) tools (Verhaegen et al, Phys Med Biol 2011:56;R55-83). Despite their usefulness on biomedical research, state-of-art laboratory-level micro-CT and micro-RT instrumentation suffers from known limitations of conventional X-ray sources such as beam polychromaticity, poor temporal resolution, poor spatial coherence. On the other hand, RF-based linear accelerators are of little help in small animal radiotherapy research due unmatched energy range (6-25 MV) for small subjects and low spatial accuracy.  The project aims at designing and setting up a proof-of-principle micro-CT/RT platform for small animals exploiting the unique features of a novel concept all-optical Thomson backscattering X-ray source. This kind of source is able to provide quasi-monochromatic X-ray pulses with duration down to ~10 fs and source size down to ~20 micrometers. The wide range of energy tunability of this source (from a few tens up to a few hundreds of keV) will enable the realization and comprehensive characterization of a prototype system for applications covering both diagnostic and therapeutic X-ray beam applications.  At the diagnostic regime (< 100 keV), the system setup will be optimized and characterized to perform both absorption-based and in line propagation-based phase-contrast 2D/3D imaging in small laboratory animals. We aim at giving particular emphasis on the dynamic imaging of the beating heart, where high spatio-temporal resolution is required due to the small sample size and high heart rate of mice and rats.   At the therapeutic regime (100-300 keV), we will exploit the high brilliance and spatial coherence of the Thomson source to explore its potential as a micro-irradiation facility for preclinical studies of tumor radiotherapy on small animals, on the same experimental setup used for imaging and hence intrinsically ready for image-guided RT.

Tali persone, però, sono ad alto rischio di non prendersi sufficientemente cura di se stessi, di nutrirsi male e di commettere errori nel seguire le prescrizioni mediche. In questo contesto, la corretta gestione dei bisogni personali e delle attività di vita quotidiana (ADL) è una sfida primaria per questa tipologia di persone quando vivono da sole.    L'utilizzo di reti di sensori per il monitoraggio delle ADL e della salute delle persone anziane sta dimostrando il suo potenziale beneficio al fine di consentire una vita autonoma. D'altro canto la sperimentazione di questo tipo di tecnologie sembra essere ancora confinata nei laboratori di ricerca dato il costo proibitivo per la sua installazione, ma anche per il basso livello di accettazione da parte dell'utente. Gli utenti, considerati come passivi rispetto alla tecnologia e con le loro azioni continuamente monitorate, percepiscono tale tecnologia come intrusiva ed impersonale e, di conseguenza, l'utilità ed il valore percepito di tali tecnologie è limitato. Discorso diverso rappresenta l'utilizzo di sistemi robotici sociali per l’assistenza. Un robot, data la sua presenza fisica e la possibilità di movimento, rappresenta un valore aggiunto in quanto può fornire pro-attivamente servizi all’utente migliorando l'accettazione e l'utilità percepita.    Obiettivo generale del progetto è quello di innalzare il livello di accettabilità di sistemi per il monitoraggio delle ADL attraverso l'utilizzo di un sistema robotico mobile i cui comportamenti siano generati in maniera adattiva rispetto alle esigenze dell'utente. Il progetto prevede una profilazione delle capacità individuali dell'utente legate alle ADL, del suo stato cognitivo e della sua personalità. In base alle informazioni raccolte, sarà possibile pianificare un insieme di attività di monitoraggio personalizzate, che adattate rispetto alla situazione corrente, rendano possibile istruire opportunamente il robot a compiere le azioni più opportune. La modalità di esecuzione stessa di tali azioni (che coinvolgono il movimento del robot nello spazio e l'interazione con l’utente) dovrà tener conto anche delle preferenze dell'utente derivabili dal suo profilo.     Il progetto, dal carattere fortemente interdisciplinare, si propone di investigare come l'adattività del comportamento robotico al profilo dell'utente possa migliorare il livello di accettazione (e di conseguenza l'efficacia) di sistemi robotici mobili per uso domestico e di assistenza, in particolare rispetto a individui con disabilità cognitive. Una tecnologia di monitoraggio dovrà essere attentamente introdotta e attuata in modo da non causare disagio ad una persona con demenza.    Il sistema sarà valutato con pazienti affetti da Alzheimer in stadio lieve o moderato, con disturbo soggettivo di memoria e deterioramento cognitivo lieve con età superiore ai 50 anni.

Metabolic syndrome is a clustering of several medical conditions, abdominal obesity, elevated blood pressure, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and diabetes. Metabolic syndrome associates with cardiovascular diseases and is becoming more common, due to a rise in obesity among adults.   Through a novel experimental platform that involves what might be called “Top-down and Bottom-up” approach, our attention will be focused on bile acid receptors, FXR and GPBAR1, on AhR and on proteasome 26S, whose relevance in the development of metabolic syndrome has been strongly implicated in the literature. The project has a multidisciplinary structure including all the steps of drug discovery: isolation, total synthesis, SAR studies, design, molecular investigation on ligand/receptor interaction, pharmacological in vitro evaluation with the final aim to propose to the bio-pharmaceutical community new hits for the treatment of metabolic diseases.  Top-down method is a target-oriented, chemical-guided approach. The study will be aimed to the discovery of new analogues of “privileged” natural chemical scaffolds able to exert modulatory activity on the selected targets. In the first step, the chemical study of terrestrial and marine sources known as producers of isoprenoid and polyphenol secondary metabolites would allow the identification of natural potential leads. A multiparametric analysis of the interaction of the isolated compounds with their partners will be performed (NMR, computational chemistry, mass spectrometry, ALPHA screen, fluorescence, surface plasmon resonance, functional proteomics, in vitro pharmacological evaluation) and the results will be helpful for a medicinal chemistry approach in the design and synthesis of simplified analogs, a step that will be also complemented by synthetic studies on molecules already known to interact with the selected targets.  Bottom-up method is a target-oriented bioactivity-guided approach aimed to expand the chemodiversity of the available modulators through the discovery of new natural metabolites with novel structural features. The study will mainly focus on marine organisms selected on the basis of preliminary pharmacological assays. In silico and functional proteomic methods will be applied for the characterization of the interactome profile and in the identification of the best candidates. The chemodiversity will be also expanded through the selection of molecules from LIBIOMOL, the first chemical library on natural and natural-derived bioactive products, created in the frame of PRIN09.  Since their usual scarce recovery from the natural sources, a bio-sustainable production of the selected natural hits will be also investigated to provide adequate amounts for future  investigations.

BWS and SRS are genomic imprinting disorders associated with opposite growth phenotypes, overgrowth and growth restriction, respectively. The majority of BWS and SRS cases are caused by epigenetic defects of  a group of evolutionary conserved genes located on chromosome 11p15.5 and chromosome 7, whose expression is determined by inheritance form the mother or the father (i. e. imprinted genes). Both conditions are associated with pre-postnatal problems and co-morbidities that have a powerful adverse impact on health and quality of life, such as delayed development and learning disabilities, early puberty, early-onset metabolic syndrome and childood cancer. BWS and SRS represent a powerful paradigm for studying these morbidities which are a growing burden to the national healthcare systems and where the role of epigenetic dysregulation is becoming widely recognized. Although, BWS and SRS affect more than 40,000 individuals in EU, they are under-diagnosed and have no specific and effective therapies. This project brings together molecular biologists, human geneticists, pediatricians as well bioinformaticians, supported by collaboration with patients support groups, who will integrate experimental models with clinical and molecular data from a large cohort of patients to bridge the gap in the aetiology of BWS and SRS and exploit this information for social and economic advantage. Through the coordinated efforts of five research units, the project focuses on three main targets: 1) defining the deregulated genes and underlying mechanisms of multi-locus imprinting disturbances (MLID) affecting a significant fraction of BWS and SRS patients and potentially causing complex phenotypes; 2) identifying novel genetic/epigenetic defects involving distant cis-acting regulatory elements or loci located at chromosomes other than 11p15 and 7; 3) generating databases of BWS and SRS patients with stable longitudinal molecular/clinical data to perform (epi)genotype-phenotype correlations. This multi-disciplinary project will deliver new molecular insights into the aetiology and pathogenesis of BWS and SRS, new directions for prevention, innovations for molecular diagnosis, novel biomarkers for prognosis and treatment, and evidence-based therapeutic strategies for the clinical management of their co-morbidities, which will serve as models of more common disorders with an epigenetic basis.

Nonostante la loro elevata efficacia terapeutica, un’ampia serie di effetti avversi ne compromette l’uso prolungato. La conoscenza fine dei meccanismi sottesi al loro funzionamento a livello molecolare permette di separare gli effetti terapeutici da quelli dannosi. I mediatori dell’azione dei GC sono in buona parte noti, ma essendo essi stessi ormoni in grado di attivare o reprimere centinaia di geni, la comprensione del ruolo di nuovi mediatori è assolutamente necessaria. Inoltre, considerando che nei processi infiammatori i linfociti T svolgono un ruolo importante con tutte le loro sottopopolazioni specializzate nella produzione di citochine specifiche, capaci anche di mantenere la “memoria immunologica” della malattia, il progetto ha come finalità quella di capire la correlazione fra vari sistemi proteici e gassosi partecipanti al processo infiammatorio e le cellule T  CD4+ di tipo Th1, Th2, Th17 e Treg in topi geneticamente modificati per GILZ (GILZ-knock-out, KO o GILZ transgenici, TG), sottoposti a vari modelli in vivo di patologie autoimmunitarie ed infiammatorie.  GILZ (Glucocorticoid-Induced Leucine Zipper) è una proteina rapidamente indotta dai GC e capace di etero-dimerizzare con molecole come NF-κB, Ras/Raf e SMAD, con conseguente blocco dell’attività trascrizionale di geni ad attività pro-infiammatoria e induzione di cellule T regolatorie, mimando, in tal modo, l’azione dei GC. Al processo infiammatorio prendono parte numerosi fattori, tra cui il sistema iNOS/NO, coinvolto nei disordini infiammatori delle articolazioni, dell’intestino e dei polmoni, e quello dell’H2S. L’H2S, è modulato dai GC e al pari dei GC sopprime il sistema iNOS/NO e modula l'attivazione delle cellule T. Altro importante fattore nell’infiammazione è la nicotinammide fosforibosil trasferasi (NAMPT), considerata un biomarcatore infiammatorio ed un possibile target terapeutico nell’artrite reumatoide (AR), in cui ne è stata descritta una sovra-espressione. Altrettanto rilevante è il sistema dell’Istamina; come noto i GC ne regolano la produzione e modulano l’espressione dei suoi recettori.   Il nostro progetto si propone di indagare la relazione esistente fra GILZ, il sistema della iNOS/NO, l’H2S , la NAMPT e l’istamina usando modelli murini di patologie infiammatorie/autoimmunitarie quali ad esempio l’AR, la colite, la fibrosi polmonare (FP), la dermatite atopica (DA) ed il dolore neuropatico conseguente al processo infiammatorio. I risultati porranno le basi per lo sviluppo di farmaci che, con un’azione mirata, agiscano selettivamente al fine di ottenere un effetto terapeutico con un esito simile a quello dei GC, mimandone gli effetti antinfiammatori/immunosoppressivi ma con minori effetti avversi.

Per ottenere questo risultato occorre fornire opportune strategie per la gestione del consumo finale di energia secondo il concetto di Demand Side Management, DSM. Demand Side Management indica ""la pianificazione, implementazione e monitoraggio delle attività destinate ad influenzare l'uso di energia elettrica  e termica da parte dei clienti finali in modo da produrre i desiderati cambiamenti nella forma della curva della domanda di elettricità"".   Questo progetto ha scelto, per l'implementazione delle strategie di gestione della domanda, un settore tra i principali responsabili del consumo finale di energia elettrica, quello     -della refrigerazione (domestica, commerciale e industriale), e    -delle pompe di calore, la cui penetrazione crescente nel campo della climatizzazione ambientale è auspicabile visti i potenziali di aumento dell'efficienza energetica che la tecnologia delle pompe di calore può apportare.  I settori della refrigerazione e del condizionamento dell'aria rappresentano infatti circa il 15% del consumo complessivo finale di energia elettrica, e quindi impattano pesantemente sulla implementazione della smart grid sul lato della domanda   Nel presente progetto si perseguono gli obiettivi prefissati operando su due linee separate ma strettamente interconnesse, definite MacroAree come segue:  MacroArea 1)   Tecnologie della refrigerazione ad elevata efficienza: qui sono incluse tutte le innovazioni introducibili nel settore della refrigerazione finalizzate all'incremento dell'efficienza energetica, come l'ottimizzazione dello scambio termico, l'impiego di fluidi refrigeranti innovativi e l'ottimizzazione termodinamica dei cicli inversi anche in regime variabile;  MacroArea 2)   Dispositivi e strategie per la gestione dei carichi termici ed elettrici: intendendo tutti i componenti necessari a realizzare sistemi integrati capaci di interagire con la smart grid, che includono sistemi di stoccaggio energetico, protocolli di interfacciamento con la rete, logiche di controllo, modelli previsionali.  Con i risultati attesi dalla ricerca sarà possibile realizzare nella pratica diverse strategie di DSM, operando a livello del singolo componente impiegato nell'unità di refrigerazione oppure a livello di sistema che integra diversi componenti.  Di conseguenza i risultati che ci si aspetta, oltre a costituire un sostanziale avanzamento nelle conoscenze relative all'integrazione tra    -innovazione nel settore della refrigerazione e delle pompe di calore e    -gestione della domanda di energia elettrica e termica,   presentano una importante ricaduta sul tessuto industriale operante nel settore specifico, ma anche in altri settori come quello dell'automazione, dell'elettrotecnica e dell'ICT."

Nonostante ciò, l’attivatore tissutale del plasminogeno è l'unico trattamento disponibile, ed il suo uso è limitato al 3-4 % dei pazienti, essendo utile solo entro 3-6 ore dall'esordio. Questi dati allarmanti impongono di attuare precocemente ogni intervento. Tra i nuovi marcatori utili per una diagnosi precoce, un ruolo rilevante è svolto dai microRNA (miRNA),una classe di RNA non codificanti, i cui livelli di espressione aumentano, a seguito di ischemia cerebrale, nel tessuto ischemico e nei liquidi circolanti. I miRNA sono piccole molecole di RNA di 20-22 nucleotidi capaci di legare numerosi RNA messaggeri, promuovendone la degradazione.   Obiettivo del presente progetto sarà lo studio dei profili di espressione di un pool di miRNA, coinvolti nella patogenesi del danno ischemico e rilasciati in circolo dopo ischemia cerebrale.   Tale obiettivo sarà perseguito mediante:   1)Selezione di almeno tre miRNA, tra cui miRNA103/107, miRNA135 e miRNA182, che regolano proteine, quali NCX, NCKX e ZnT1, coinvolte nell’omeostasi ionica e determinanti per la patogenesi dell’ictus. L’espressione di tali miRNA sarà monitorata nel tessuto cerebrale di animali ischemici e in colture neuronali esposte a deprivazione di ossigeno e glucosio e poi validata mediante saggi di luciferasi e determinazione dell’attività delle proteine di interesse. Successivamente i livelli di tali miRNA saranno monitorati nel plasma di animali ischemici e confermati in pazienti ischemici.   2)Progettazione e realizzazione di nanosensori di tipo Lab-on-Fiber, nano-probes, in grado di rilevare in real time e in modalità label-free concentrazioni fM dei miRNA target, sfruttando l’interazione luce-materia confinata su scala nanometrica.   3)Progettazione e realizzazione di sonde molecolari a base di DNA e RNA da integrare sulle piattaforme in fibra per la cattura e la rivelazione dei miRNA target: a)nanoparticelle d’oro per concentrare gli analiti ed aumentarne apparentemente le dimensioni e interazione ottica con il trasduttore in fibra; b)microgeli per sfruttare principi e meccanismi innovativi di biosensing possibili grazie all’accoppiamento con la fibra ottica.   4)Sviluppo di sistema opto-fluidico compatto per gestire in maniera automatica l'interazione dei flussi delle soluzioni da analizzare con i nanosensori in fibra.  5)Validazione del device in termini di sensibilità, riproducibilità e velocità di analisi in studi comparativi condotti con tecniche canoniche sia su campioni animali che di origine umana.  Le proprietà uniche della fibra ottica, integrabili all’interno di aghi e cateteri, gettano solide basi per la creazione di sonde utili per la determinazione dei miRNA nel tessuto. Il monitoraggio combinato di almeno tre miRNA accorcerà i tempi per la prognosi e la diagnosi della malattia, consentendo un trattamento più efficace dei pazienti.
100|grant.6857027|2015TM24JS|Perception, Performativity and Cognitive Sciences|Perception, Performativity and Cognitive Sciences|The aim of this research project is to focus on (and test) the hypothesis that performativity is not a property confined to certain specific human skills, or to certain specific acts of language, nor an accidental enrichment due to creative intelligence. Instead, the executive and motor component of cognitive behavior should be considered an intrinsic part of the physiological functioning of the mind and as endowed with self-generative power. It is thought to have evolutionarily developed in close correlation with processes of natural selection leading, in the human animal, on the one hand, to the species specificity of articulate speech and, on the other, to embodied simulation as a model of perception. In this perspective, cognition is considered a mediated form of action rather than a relationship between inner thought and behavior occurring in the outside world. In this model of performativity, action is never considered mere externalization of a mental process, but is a cognitive process through which the body produces it. Every species-specific embodied form is a way to know reality available to all human beings.  Performativity, in this theoretical context, can be defined as a constituent component of cognitive processes. The material action allowing us to interact with reality is both the means by which the subject knows the surrounding world and one through which he experiments with the possibilities of his body. This innovative proposal is rooted in models now widely accepted in the philosophy of mind and language (see B1); in fact, it focuses on a space of awareness that is not in the individual, or outside it, but is determined by the species-specific ways in which the body acts on the world. It is the body to determine the cognitive ability of the individual, not mental abstract internal procedures, nor just environmental inputs.  This theoretical hypothesis will be pursued through the latest interdisciplinary methodology typical of cognitive science. On the one hand, in fact, it needs to clarify some philosophical positions brought to light by the philosophical thesis of embodied cognition and numerous interpretations of the extended mind (see B1), often at odds with the most internalist and mentalist hypotheses on cognitive psychology and computationalism. On the other hand, it has to clarify the philosophical problems investigated, because, in line with the naturalist presuppositions of the cognitive neuro-scientific investigation, they require thorough experimental investigation in different fields of application. Thus, a significant slice of the project will try to clarify the contribution of an extended theory of performativity to experimental research on perception, performative arts and the creative use of media devices.

La categoria della vulnerabilità, in quanto parte ineliminabile della condizione esistenziale umana, può mostrare la sua rilevanza pratica sul versante della tutela dei diritti delle persone. Ciò richiede però un’opera di chiarificazione e precisazione concettuale. Vulnerabilità, infatti, è nozione ancora altamente indeterminata. Presenta connessioni con l’insicurezza, prodotta in vari modi (alcuni anche violenti) dal potere esercitato sugli altri. Rinvia, altresì, all’alterità, al riconoscimento, all’interdipendenza, alla fiducia, alla solidarietà. Guardare alla vulnerabilità quale aspetto ineliminabile della soggettività significa ripensare alcune delle categorie tipiche della modernità, relative all’individuo e alle istituzioni giuridico-politiche, al fine di fornire un contributo alla soluzione di alcuni problemi centrali riguardanti l’interazione e l’inclusione sociale nelle odierne società pluralistiche e culturalmente variegate, attraverso la predisposizione di strumenti concettuali idonei ad affrontarli. In questa prospettiva, il paradigma della vulnerabilità è indagato prendendo in considerazione il suo impatto sul modello dello Stato di diritto, finalizzato a garantire le spettanze proprie delle persone in un’ottica relazionale. La ricerca, assumendo un approccio critico e normativo, si concentra sull’analisi della nozione di vulnerabilità, prestando attenzione: alla sua dimensione universale, declinata in chiave plurale e sensibile alla diversità culturale; alla sua relazione con l’autonomia e l’eguaglianza; alla sua caratterizzazione in collegamento alla crisi del welfare e alla rideterminazione dei diritti sociali; al suo configurarsi in rapporto alle trasformazioni bio-tecnologiche, che pongono in primo piano le questioni della qualità della vita, della sicurezza, della responsabilità intergenerazionale; al suo funzionamento con riguardo agli interventi pubblici e agli strumenti di tutela antidiscriminatoria; al ruolo che tale concetto può assumere in sede di interpretazione e applicazione del diritto. La vulnerabilità può essere considerata come concetto di senso che assume una significativa salienza per ridefinire alcune categorie centrali del diritto nell’epoca attuale, guardando alla concretezza della vita degli esseri umani. Si tratta di un concetto, per molto tempo rimosso dal pensiero giuridico e politico, che può mostrare la sua utilità nell’elaborazione di uno strumentario teorico e nel ridisegnare modelli istituzionali capaci di rispondere alle sfide che la società globale del rischio pone.

The ageing phenotype is multi-dimensional, age and gender-dependent, and determined by interactions among genes, acquired epi-genetic imprinting and environmental factors. Research on the ageing process has greatly progressed,nevertheless, defining how to achieve healthy ageing  and identifying  which life-time trajectories are associated with positive health and wellbeing in older age still requires  further investigations.  Metabolic changes deeply impact the ageing process. Dissecting how metabolic pathways are affected by environmental, genetic and epigenetic interactions and defining how this participate in the  ageing processes regulation  is instrumental in obtaining more insight on  how to achieve healthy ageing. In the present project, using a metabolomics approach to identify  novel candidate biomarkers for a specific age related phenotype (normal ageing, which reflects biological age, successful ageing and ageing with pathology) as well as mortality rate, we will try to design  predictive models  estimating different trajectories in the ageing process and/or  shaping the  mortality risk. Furthermore, focusing  on impaired insulin action, chronic low-grade inflammation and the accompanying atherosclerotic processes closely associated with frailty and age-related diseases, we will try to clarify genetics and epigenetics factors underlying metabolites alterations and  the resulting phenotypes,  so to identify  anti ageing properties of specific metabolites potentially able to prevent senescence in different cells and tissues (vascular/endothelial cells, preadipocytes, skeletal muscle and brain).  The individuation of biomarkers for early detection of diseases and the early identification of individuals at risk of developing frailty  would greatly improve the care of aged subjects by  allowing  the development of interventions targeting specific pathways associated with multiple chronic conditions and morbidities and the delivering of effective prevention strategies.
100|grant.6856696|2015RZWMMT|Labor and Finance|Labor and Finance|This research proposal revolves around three main themes in the area of labor and finance. First, it will explore how interactions between firms and employees affect firm leverage, and how in turn leverage affects employment and wages. Second, it will investigate the extent to which firms provide insurance to their employees against adverse shocks, and how this risk sharing varies depending on firm characteristics (such as standalone status or participation to a business group) and institutional arrangements (such as social security arrangements). Finally, the project will analyse the effects of the design of managerial employment contracts on managers’ incentives to act in the interest of owners, and in particular whether these incentives differ between widely and closely held firms. The hallmark of the proposed empirical studies is their focus on institutional changes (especially labor market and social security reforms) to identify the relationships of interest, as well as their reliance on detailed merged employer-employee data sets, chiefly one that will include (i) firm-level balance sheet data, drawn from the Cerved database, the Centrale dei Bilanci and Aida, and (ii) individual employee histories based on administrative data, that will be drawn from the INPS database within the framework of the VISITINPS program.

I due stati sono regolati da molecole segnale e specifici fattori trascrizionali che  formano reti di interazioni straordinariamente complesse e dinamiche.  Il presente progetto ha lo scopo di chiarire i meccanismi molecolari responsabili del cambio di identità delle cellule staminali pluripotenti.  Esperimenti effettuati nei nostri ed in altri laboratori dimostrano che Otx2 ed Oct4 si redistribuiscono su elementi regolatori (promotori ed “enhancer”) del genoma durante la transizione da ESC ad EpiSC. I nostri dati dimostrano che nella regolazione di questa transizione hanno un ruolo determinante Hmga2, Dnmt3a, che sono specificamente indotti, ed NF-YAs  che, al contrario, è regolato negativamente. La nostra ipotesi di lavoro è che promotori ed “enhancer” siano resi accessibili in maniera differenziale nei due stati delle cellule staminali dai fattori pionieri NF-YAs ed Hmga2 e dal regolatore epigenetico Dnmt3a. I gruppi proponenti, mettendo insieme diverse competenze, studieranno l’interazione funzionale tra questi regolatori, per comprendere i meccanismi molecolari ed i circuiti di regolazione che controllano lo stato di staminalità e la transizione dallo stato staminale basale a quello permissivo per il differenziamento. Specificamente, saranno: 1.Studiate le cooperazioni ed i circuiti di regolazione mediati da Hmga2, Otx2, Dnmt3a e NF-YAs.  2.Identificati i geni regolati positivamente da Otx2, Hmga2 e negativamente da Dnmt3a e NF-YAs, determinanti nella regolazione della staminalità e nella transizione ESC-EpiSC. 3.Caratterizzati i complessi molecolari di Oct4, Otx2, Hmga2, NF-Y e le loro interazioni molecolari. 4.Studiata la regolazione di Hmga2 e Dnmt3a nella transizione ESC-EpiSC. 5.Analizzati in vivo, mediante analisi di mutanti, i ruoli funzionali dei regolatori degli eventi che determinano, durante lo sviluppo embrionale preimpianto, il differenziamento della ICM  nell'epiblasto primario, endoderma primitivo e trofoectoderma.  Questi esperimenti permetteranno di dissezionare e comprendere la rete di interazioni che regolano il cambiamento di identità delle cellule staminali pluripotenti; forniranno un quadro completo di quali siano i geni regolati specificamente da ciascuno dei fattori in esame e l’interazione funzionale di ciascuno di essi; consentiranno di  identificare  i bersagli molecolari che saranno studiati alla luce dei dati fenotipici.  Gli esperimenti proposti potranno essere effettuati grazie alla  collaborazione sinergica dei gruppi proponenti.

Consequently, efforts are being undertaken to facilitate the travel of bona-fide and genuine passengers and, at the same time, to safeguard a high level of security. In this kind of context, the use of multimodal biometrics might provide the key for increasing the level of security while reducing the failures inevitably associated with the use of a single identifier in a typically uncontrolled environment. As a further element to consider, practical experiences lead to privilege a most fluent and non-intrusive control process for non-critical travelers (EU, bona-fide etc.). Therefore the use of contactless capturing techniques and their implementation on consumer-level mobile devices is likely to be preferred over contact-based technologies and dedicated devices. Overall, COSMOS (COntactlesS Multibiometric mObile System in the wild) aims at delivering a comprehensive approach to multi-biometric person verification and recognition, including most contact-less biometrics, flexibly integrated through a context-adaptive acquisition/matching strategy based on their complementarity and exploiting the agile and ubiquitous hardware platforms represented by last generation smartphones and tablets. More in practice, the project will exploit the specific knowledge of each of the participants to provide an unprecedented unified biometric platform for contactless person verification/recognition by means of both hard biometrics like face (both in 2D and 3D), iris, ear, fingerprint/palmprint and soft biometrics like gait and gaze. Moreover, multi-tracking methods will be also developed to enabling screening-from-distance capabilities to allow the proposed system to detect subjects of interest or potential threats to be checked in detail by the other biometric modalities. COSMOS is expected to fostering the research and application of new ideas in the field of biometry by providing three major contributions to the field: the effective and efficient implementation of the single modalities on mobile architectures in the challenging ""in-the-wild"" scenario; the complimentary integration of these biometrics by innovative data fusion strategies to maximize the discriminating potential of the different identifiers considered according to a wide range of operative conditions and the novel smart management of the crucial privacy issues related to a multi-biometric system. Finally, since in Italy as well in other EU and extra-EU countries, strict data protection prescriptions regulate the use of biometrics, COSMOS will devote a specific emphasis to data protection, social, medical and ethical issues."

PD has a multifactorial nature, and features autonomic non-motor dysfunctions, for example at the level of the gut. Mitochondrial dysfunction has emerged as a major player in neuronal demise featuring PD. In this regard, it is noteworthy that mitochondria critically regulate inflammatory processes, and that heightened inflammation has also emerged as a key factor in PD. Building on this evidence, this project aims to elucidate the interplay among mitochondrial dysfunction, mutated alpha-syn, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration in three experimental mouse models of PD, the A53T alpha-syn hemizygous mouse, the Rhes knock-out (KO) mouse and the chronic MPTP + probenecid (MPTPp)-treated mouse. The project will characterize the interplay among behavioral impairment, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation and genetic or toxic determinants in the onset and progression of the PD-like pathology from the gut to the nervous system. This general aim will be pursued first by evaluating models of PD motor and non-motor deficits during the progression of neurodegeneration. By studying the behavioral and neurochemical changes, the project will evaluate the spreading of the pathology from the gut through the vagus nerve, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, locus coeruleus, substantia nigra and caudate-putamen by studying in these structures: i) markers of DAergic and noradrenergic degeneration; ii) levels of alpha-syn, mitochondria sodium/calcium exchanger (NCX), NCX1, NCX3, pro-inflammatory interleukins (ILs) and the Nod-like receptor pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome; iii) the relationship between the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and mitochondrial dysfunction; iv) the expression of microRNA (miR) directly related to development of DAergic neurons and the modifications in mitochondrial function in neurons and microglial cells obtained from different models of PD; v) the relationship between the levels and activity of NCX1 and NCX3 and the expression of miR-34b,c and miR-218; vi) the neuroprotective effects of adenosine A2A receptor antagonists. By utilizing an innovative and multifaceted approach which encompasses genetic modifications, cellular, in vivo and ex vivo studies, this project will help to clarify the relationship among mitochondrial dysfunction, alpha-syn, neuroinflammation and DA neuron degeneration, opening new avenues for alternative therapeutic strategies in PD.

Each subsystem must both exist as an independent entity and become part of wider systems when needed. This vision radically changes the notion of “integrated” system:  - Subsystems offer limited interaction capabilities and little possibility to be controlled  - Although the number of subsystems available at runtime might be huge, their cooperation can be ad-hoc and only needed in specific cases or conditions  - Often there is no prior, complete, knowledge of the subsystems, thus their presence and capabilities must be inferred dynamically when the need for cooperation arises.  Recent solutions for the integration of these large-scale Systems of Systems (SoS) are domain and technology specific, aimed to solve particular problems or focused on systems heterogeneity, rather than aimed to manage these systems in different contexts and conditions.    The GAUSS project will deliver the methodological enablers required to identify, integrate, and manage “emergent” SoS (eSoS). These require dynamic and opportunistic engineering due to their intrinsically variable nature tied to their scale and heterogeneity. GAUSS will release a set of integrated technologies to address these engineering problems of eSoS at runtime, when specific execution contexts may invalidate design-time solutions. GAUSS will govern eSoS by enriching initial lightweight designs with concrete and contextualised aspects obtained from the runtime context.    GAUSS will contribute in three areas:    Models. GAUSS will extensively exploit models of functional and nonfunctional requirements, of the context and of the governance policies, to successfully integrate independently designed subsystems. GAUSS will define lightweight design methods and techniques to infer these models at runtime from systems not designed to obey to GAUSS requirements.     Runtime analysis. GAUSS will address the dynamic evolution of the system architecture and integration logic by combining: architecture synthesis techniques based on parameterized integration, coordination and adaptation patterns; techniques that automatically extract accurate behavior models from streams of continuous observations; online V&V procedures that continuously assess the fitness-for-purpose and dependability of eSoS.    Automatic governance. GAUSS will raise the level of confidence that people and society place on eSoS by: defining adaptation rules compatible with governance policies and context to avoid negative interferences and unstable behaviors; reconfiguring and optimizing inefficient and critical eSoS subsystems; providing self-protection mechanisms to avoid failures.

In tali contesti, alle condizioni critiche proprie della città contemporanea relative a vivibilità, dotazione di servizi, identità, prestazioni ambientali e consumi di risorse, si affianca il tendenziale peggioramento delle condizioni climatiche, con l’incremento di eventi meteorologici estremi legati a precipitazioni e temperature. In campo architettonico, l’adattamento a tali condizioni richiede la messa a punto di metodologie e strumenti innovativi per limitarne gli impatti sul sistema urbano, che hanno ricadute dirette di tipo ambientale ma anche implicazioni socio-economiche, come evidenziato nel documento Cohesion Policy 2014-2020 che indica la progettualità adattiva ed “ecosystem-based” quali strategia per incrementare la resilienza urbana.  Attraverso approcci di adaptive design in aree caratterizzate da trend ambientali critici, la ricerca intende indagare l’applicabilità di indirizzi strategici e soluzioni di progettazione tecnologica e ambientale con ricadute sulla riduzione dell’esposizione ai rischi climatici e sulla sostenibilità socio-economica attraverso progetti dimostratori di tipo sperimentale.   La ricerca si focalizza su processi e progetti innovativi di rigenerazione adattiva, quale valore aggiunto per un approccio sostenibile e resiliente agli effetti del cambiamento climatico. Ricorrendo a innovazioni tecnologiche di processo, progetto e prodotto, si simuleranno scenari e valuteranno prestazioni, definendo procedure, metodologie e strumenti operativi, attuando strategie e soluzioni alla scala locale per ridurre la vulnerabilità dei distretti urbani.   Risultati della ricerca saranno progetti dimostratori localizzati in contesti urbani con criticità specifiche per indicare proiezioni, linee di sviluppo, scenari di innovazione, sperimentazioni progettuali e sistemiche. Con modalità operative interscalari si definiranno corrispondenze efficaci tra la gestione delle risorse, la governance dei processi e l’attivazione di micro e macro azioni di rigenerazione (attraverso interventi ex novo e di retrofit tecnologico), per ridurre la vulnerabilità climatica del sistema urbano alla scala di distretti, edifici e spazi aperti.   Le diverse U.O. esprimono specifiche expertise interdisciplinari per definire un quadro di conoscenze condiviso e proporre soluzioni di design adattivo confrontabili, replicabili e misurabili, per modelli di governance urbana climate-oriented. Il network operativo costituirà un fattore di vantaggio competitivo per competenze e capacità di diffusione di know how, anche grazie a confronti scientifici con prestigiosi partner internazionali.

Although innate immunity has been shown to be important in the cardiac remodeling to myocardial infarction, the basis for initiation of the inflammatory reaction in chronic pressure overload remains poorly understood.   An intriguing issue is how immune cells realize the crosstalk with cardiomyocytes (CMs), in order to commit their adaptive or maladaptive response. Recent studies revealed that the inflammasome, a multiprotein oligomer that assembles in response to pathogenic microorganisms or sterile stressors and acts as a platform for caspase-1 activation and IL1β maturation/secretion, exists even in cell types different from immune cells, including cardiomyocytes. It is conceivable that an initial recruitment of innate immunity is necessary to establish a compensatory response to the cardiac pressure overload. This “adaptive” moment should be realized through a balanced dealing among innate immune cells and cardiomyocytes, thus posing the hypothesis that an initial activation of immunity is beneficial for cardiac remodeling. On the other hand, it is well known that a prolonged exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines, like IL1β and TNFα, upregulated in cardiac stress and failure, negatively affects cardiomyocytes contractility.   On these bases, this project is aimed at search the mechanisms that control the shift between beneficial and detrimental roles of activation of immune responses in cardiac remodeling. We believe that the unraveling of “adaptive” and “maladaptive” paradigms of immune system activation would be instrumental for treating the heart failure that inevitably evolve due to inadequate adaptation to chronic hemodynamic overload. The general strategy that our research groups will apply is based on pathophysiological and mechanistic studies in the experimental model in mice, aimed at dissecting the role played by immunity in cardiac remodeling to pressure overload and how the dealing with cardiomyocytes is realized, both in adaptive and in maladaptive phases. Moreover, we will take advantage of the emerging technologies exploiting the systematic, unbiased characterization of variation in genes, RNA, proteins and metabolites associated with disease conditions and outcomes, to search adaptive vs maladaptive pathways in specific immune and cardiomyocytes population.   In this scenario, great interest lies in the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating the adverse cardiac remodeling and prevent heart failure. For this purpose, we propose to characterize the immune profile even in the clinical setting, in order to find a correlation with disease progression, helping in the management of patients and in better defining the therapeutic strategies.

The Horizon 2020 Expert Group on CH argues that: “Cultural Heritage must be seen as a special, but integral, component in the production of European GDP and innovation, its growth process, competitiveness and in the welfare of European society. Like environmental protection, it should be mainstreamed into policy and regarded as a production factor in economic and wider policy development”.  Considering that Italy is exposed to several natural (i.e. strong earthquakes, floods and catastrophic landslides, etc.) and human-induced (such as subsidence) hazards, and among those  new challenges are posed by climate changes, safeguarding the CH against the increasing intensity of water-soil interaction related threats, is an urgent need for this non-renewable assets. In this regards, the current trend is to promote a shared and unifying approach to CH management, involving all the interested players and stakeholders. In this perspective, this project will develop a novel and consistent strategy for the risk assessment and mitigation of CH exposed to water-soil threats and will identify priorities and valorisation actions for specific assets.  Project goals will be pursued by a systematic deepening of several theoretical and methodological issues that will provide: an advanced modelling of selected hazards; quick damage assessment based on advanced understanding of soil-structure interaction; a novel multi-scale monitoring system; eco innovative solutions for CH restoration; valorisation policy for CH at risk and innovative management solutions for specific sites under severe pressure of natural hazards.  The achievement of consistent results is fostered by the multi-disciplinary, multi-risk and multi-scale setting of the project. It is multidisciplinary with experts from geotechnical, structural and telecommunication engineering, sociology, signal and image processing, end-users. It is multi-risk including fast (debris flow, flash flooding, etc.) and slow moving landslide threats as well as subsidence. It is multi-scale since the research will consider three different scales, from the River Basin District (1:100,000-1:25,000) to the specific site (>1:2,000). Besides, the project is based on a case studies approach pre-selected so as to cover the most significant CH structures typologies and hazards within the scope of the project. For each case study, target stakeholders were invited to participate and an End User Group was composed including decision-makers and high-level representatives from local and national organizations.  The pursued integrated approach and the involvement of end-users will allow to simply pass from theory to practice and will enhance the synergy among technicians, stakeholders and decision makers.
100|grant.6854881|2015FMRE5X|The economics of old age risks|The economics of old age risks|This project focuses on the economic effects of risks faced by older individuals and their interactions. The project investigates four different types of risk and their impact on the economic behavior of individuals and households, including the implications for the design of welfare systems in aging societies.     1. Health risk. We analyze the impact of health risks on saving decisions and portfolio allocations and on the demand for insurance of older people, such as Long Term Care, taking into account the role of informal care. We look at the nexus between health status (including cognitive abilities) and economic decisions, in particular the dynamic relationship between health, medical treatments and economic outcomes.     2. Longevity risk. The project focuses on the optimal level of wealth annuitization, the interaction between pension arrangements and wealth annuitization, the effect of expected survival probabilities on economic outcomes, with regard to the demand for insurance and the intensity of bequest motives and intergenerational solidarity.    3. Labor market risk. European mature men and women have increased their labor market participation, but the unemployment risk has also increased for this age group. It is relevant to study labor market contracts that insure at least part of this risk, and the extent to which early retirement schemes limit the effect of labor market risk at the end of working life and mitigate rigidities in the labor market.     4. Financial risk. The issue of how adequate savings are for current and future retirees is of great importance for public policy, pension design, and financial markets regulation. Related issues are the analysis of financial instruments that allow housing equity withdrawals and improve  portfolio diversification.    The network proposes an integrated and interdisciplinary approach to these topics. First, all the aforementioned risks interact in the decisions of elderly individuals. Second, in each risk dimension, it is key to study the consequences of wrong decisions, due to either lack of cognitive abilities and financial sophistication, or to biased financial advice.     The project proposes advances at both theoretical and empirical level. Although the different lines of research will make use of several microeconomic data sets, the most heavily exploited data source will be the Survey of Health Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), which is now available from 2004 to 2013. The panel structure of SHARE allows the estimation of dynamic decision models controlling for unobserved heterogeneity, while the multi-country nature of the data permits to relate individual behavior to the institutional characteristics of each country. As a by-product of our research, we expect to contribute also to the econometric and statistical literature on missing data, non-response and attrition in surveys, and measurement error in microdata.

E’ improbabile ritenere che questo fenomeno, così pervasivo, abbia lasciato immune l’arena politica, e diverse osservazioni confermano la contaminazione fra problemi dell’economia e difficoltà della politica: la fragilità dei governi messi alla prova di nuove elezioni; il diffondersi dell’insoddisfazione per il funzionamento delle democrazie; la nascita e il successo di movimenti e partiti populisti; la pervasività di politiche capaci di alterare consolidati equilibri redistributivi; il mutato equilibrio esecutivo-legislativo.  Il presente progetto parte tuttavia dall’ipotesi nulla. Non tanto dall’idea che la crisi non abbia alcuna ripercussione nell’arena politica, cosa che sarebbe in contraddizione con buona parte di ciò che sappiamo dalla letteratura di scienze sociali, ma dall’ipotesi che in periodi di crisi non vi siano relazioni qualitativamente diverse fra i due universi.  Partire dall’ipotesi nulla, dal presupposto che la crisi non configuri nient’altro che un ambiente più estremo da governare, e non una complessità unica, ha diversi vantaggi. Stabilisce un benchmark realistico, la cui conferma non costituirebbe semplicemente una deludente evidenza in negativo. Permette di meglio comprendere in cosa la crisi stia eventualmente modificando il funzionamento delle democrazie avanzate, distinguendo fra cambiamenti di grado e di qualità. Suggerisce di connettere trasformazioni e dinamiche in campi anche molto diversi dell’arena politica.  La ricerca si muoverà lungo tre direttrici, che definiscono i tre workpackages lungo la quale è organizzata. La prima direttrice investe il lato dell’input e l’ipotetico cambiamento nelle modalità e nei contenuti della rappresentanza, a partire dalla struttura dei cleavages per arrivare ai nuovi partiti politici, passando attraverso le nuove forme di mobilitazione sociale e i comportamenti di voto. La seconda direttrice si incentra sulle istituzioni, in primis parlamenti ed esecutivi, con le loro caratteristiche, funzioni e agende. Infine, la terza direttrice si focalizza sull’output, o meglio sulla dimensione politica e istituzionale del policy-making in settori chiave – il budget e il welfare sopra tutti. L’ipotesi nulla e la sua eventuale falsificazione passa anche attraverso la ridefinizione dei legami fra queste tre direttrici.  Sotto il profilo metodologico, la ricerca che proponiamo è esplicitamente di tipo comparativo. Una comparazione che vedrà al centro il caso italiano, e una within-case analysis di tipo diacronico, in alcuni campi. Che diventerà una comparazione con N piccolo – fondata sul process tracing, sulla comparazione sistematica di 4-6 paesi e sulla Qualitative Comparative Analysis – in altri. E che si avvarrà di un N ampio, e della potenzialità dei Big data, là dove è appropriato adottare modelli di tipo econometrico.

[Science 1995, 270, 1789] The 2012 witnessed one of the key leaps forward, with the introduction of self-assembling hybrid halide perovskites as active components of solution-processable solid-state solar cells. Hybrid perovskite materials hold the promise of potential resolution to some of the most important limitations of third generation PV. [Nature 2012, 485, 486; Science 2012, 338, 643; Nature, 2013, 499, 316]   Hybrid perovskites are crystalline solids consisting of an inorganic metal halide framework with small organic molecules in its voids, combining organic easy processability with inorganic high charge conductivity. They become the ultimate material for next generation PV devices due to their panchromatic light absorption and efficient ambipolar charge transport. Providing those characteristics, a plethora of device layouts have been explored and outstanding power conversion efficiencies have been reached, as over 20% is being now measured in labs [Science, 2015, 348, 1243; Science, 2015, 350, 917; Prog. Photovoltaics: Res. Appl. 2015, 23, 805] and 21% has been recently certified.  [http://www.nrel.gov/ncpv/images/efficiency_chart.jpg]. Despite the extraordinary progresses, the technology presents the intrinsic issues of newcomers. The main limitations interfering with perovskite solar cell (PSC) large-scale production are related to a critical material deposition/reproducibility as the film formation occurs throughout a complex self-assembly process driven by weak interactions, which also results in poor stability of the material and of the device. [Nature Mater. 2014, 13, 838] In addition, the most exploited, for PV applications, methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite contains lead, a potentially poisoning components that, ideally, has to be replaced without affecting device performances. PERSEO project aims to address these problematic through an ambitious, cutting-edge research program, which will have a great impact on the scientific community by bringing the PSC technology to the final maturation stage suitable for an industrialization process. The goal strongly relates in needing an intelligent mastering of material preparation, a profound comprehension of its physical-chemical properties and a detailed identification of scaling-up processes.   The team comprises research units that are worldwide front runners of perovskite-based optoelectronic exploitation and such project represents the opportunity of bringing them together giving birth to an exceptional next generation solar conversion Italian hub.

Among the epigenetic mechanisms, the methylation of genomic DNA might represent a transcriptional regulator in stroke. In fact, recent evidence demonstrated that an increase in genomic DNA methylation occurs during stroke and it is associated to a worsening of brain damage. However, the effectors of this epigenetic mechanism in brain ischemia are still unexplored. In this regards, the methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), a key known reader of genomic methylation involved in development, stress response, synaptic plasticity and homeostasis, might exert a role in the expression of several neuroprotectant or neurodetrimental genes during stroke. In this project we will evaluate the contribution of MeCP2 in the regulation of the expression of several neuroprotective proteins after stroke, including plasmamembrane proteins participating in the ionic homeostasis and in the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia. For instance, previous reports show that in the brain the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger genes, that exert a neuroprotective effect in stroke (Molinaro et al J Neuroscience 2008; Formisano et al J Neurosci 2015; Molinaro et al JCBFM 2015), are up-regulated in MeCP2 knock-out mice and downregulated in transgenic mice overexpressing MeCP2 (Baker, et al. Cell 2013; Zhao, et al. Neurobiol of Disease 2013; Samaco, et al. Nat Gen 2012). It is conceivable to hypothesize that MeCP2 by regulating the expression of neuroprotective genes might exert a role in stroke pathophysiology. To test this hypothesis we will (I) select putative neuroprotective or neurodegenerative target genes of MeCP2 following stroke by ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq), including proteins participating in the ionic homeostasis and stroke-related transcription factors; (II) analyze expression and cellular colocalization of MeCP2 and its putative target genes in the brain following ischemia; (III) identify the MeCP2-driven transcription machineries involved in the regulation of target genes in stroke; (IV) determine the contribution of MeCP2 in gene regulation and its transcription machineries in the pathophysiology of stroke.  The identification of MeCP2-driven epigenetic mechanisms in stroke damage might provide new target for a pharmacological intervention in cerebral ischemia, that is a leading cause of serious long-term disability and death in the Western countries.  $IMM_PER_0007

Rights and constitutionalism between revolutions and restorations (1789-1848)|Il progetto si sviluppa dall’ipotesi di ricerca che le idee di fondo della politica e della cultura delle democrazie contemporanee siano largamente riconducibili alla cultura illuminista, e siano il frutto di un processo storico segnato da dibattiti e aspre lotte attorno ad alcuni concetti-chiave: eguaglianza fra gli esseri umani, diritti fondamentali, libertà, costituzione. Questa è, nelle sue linee essenziali, l’eredità politica e culturale dell’Illuminimo, quella che ha contribuito in misura decisiva alla nascita della modernità democratica.  L’obiettivo del progetto consiste dunque nella ricostruzione del ruolo svolto da questa eredità nella genesi dell’Europa contemporanea, che può essere individuata nel periodo cruciale compreso tra la Rivoluzione francese e il 1848.  La delimitazione cronologica della ricerca ha infatti un preciso significato storiografico. A fronte di una lettura dominante che intende la prima metà dell’Ottocento come il rovesciamento o il superamento della fase storica tardosettecentesca – il sorgere dei nazionalismi e dunque l’oblio del soggetto individuale e universalista dell’Illuminismo, la ripresa del ruolo egemonico delle Chiese, la temperie antirazionalista della Restaurazione come liquidazione del linguaggio politico dei Lumi –, il progetto intende invece verificare la presenza di continuità spesso sotterranee, di dialettiche positive che gravitano attorno a nuclei strategici quali le rivendicazioni costituzionaliste, la lotta per l’abolizione della schiavitù, l’evoluzione delle scienze dell’uomo. In questo senso il terminus a quo della ricerca non può che essere il 1789, visto non come conclusione di un secolo, bensì, al contrario, come trauma originario che influenza una lunga fase storica che si compie solo alla metà del secolo successivo. Il 1848, con il sorgere della questione operaia e la definitiva abolizione della schiavitù nelle colonie francesi, costituisce invece il naturale terminus ad quem di questa parabola.  L’eredità dei Lumi, dunque, sarà analizzata attraverso una serie di case studies affidati a diversi componenti delle UR che toccano sia i processi di circolazione delle idee di libertà, di eguaglianza, di diritti inalienabili dell’uomo – divenute egemoni nel Tardo Illuminismo –, sia il consolidamento di queste in pratiche e teorie, coprendo quindi una gamma di temi che va dal ruolo dell’opinione pubblica alla traduzione dei diritti in termini politici e giuridici. La storia politica e costituzionale, lo sviluppo delle scienze dell’uomo, la rielaborazione dei diritti fondamentali nel linguaggio della cultura e delle arti costituiscono i nuclei di interesse primario della ricerca che qui si propone. I risultati attesi possono preludere a una radicale ridefinizione della storia politica dell’Europa, nonché della geografia e della cronologia della genesi del mondo contemporaneo.

Among the cited challenges, we plan to solve the following target problems:  • Structural analysis of Heritage building and Reliability of masonry structures  • Next generation materials and methodologies for vibration abatement and enhanced design  • Structural nonlinear analysis of Concrete and Composite buildings  It is believed that the key to successfully approach such a broad range of problems is the study of the mechanical behavior of innovative materials, relying on effective constitutive and structural modeling and advanced numerical methods. Such investigations require a final validation step, implemented through the analysis of specific real-life case studies, belonging to different engineering areas in which innovation is needed.  The study of the mentioned problems will be performed by using a multidisciplinary approach, involving interactions of several internationally recognized research units, which have already proved their capability of mutual collaboration (having won many PRIN and European Grants). The Research will focus on the following four different levels:  1. CONSTITUTIVE MODELS to capture material responses of importance for the applications of interest. In particular, attention will be devoted to classes of materials and effects, ranging from concrete, masonry, FRCM composites to carbon-nanotubes.  2. STRUCTURAL MODELS to capture the response of macro- and micro-structures of interest.   3. NUMERICAL METHODS to perform simulations of real-life cases related to the project applications. In particular, attention will be devoted to integration schemes for the proposed constitutive equations as well as to techniques for the solution of initial/boundary-value problems, e.g., advanced approaches for nonlinear structural statics and dynamics, meshless methods for multiphysics interaction, homogenization and multiscale methods for micro/macro interaction.  4. REAL-LIFE CASE STUDIES to validate both the proposed constitutive models and numerical methods as tools to explore innovative solutions within the project target problems. In particular, the project will propose innovative solutions for the following real-life applications:  • Structural analysis of real masonry buildings (in Perugia, Venice, Palermo, Emilia Romagna, Rome);  • Design of sustainable retrofit techniques for civil structures based on high-performance concrete and composite materials;  • Development of advanced monitoring tools for structures and infrastructures.  For the topics under investigation we plan to adopt a virtual testing approach. Accordingly, the numerical models are calibrated using experimental data produced within the project.

These gatekeepers are those professional figures possessing a significant amount of knowledge concerning how people should be guided in the exploration of cultural contents. In this sense, they act as mediators between cultural heritage and visitors by using a set of communication strategies, both verbal and non-verbal, aimed at maintaining a high level of engagement and delivering high-quality content. The overall experience of accessing cultural heritage is greatly enriched by these professional figures: their knowledge and experience, therefore, should not be overlooked when designing artificial agents oriented to cultural heritage presentation. As this knowledge is primarily based on experience collected on the field, the CHROME project aims at recording the performance of gatekeepers in a sensible environment so that formal analysis of their behaviour can be documented and studied. The result of this process, conducted jointly by humanities and computer scientists will lead to the formalization of a model describing the behaviour gatekeepers adopt when presenting cultural heritage. This will then be used to control a humanoid robot designed to follow similar presentation strategies. The main goals of the project are:    1) collect and provide the scientific community with reference datasets to study human-human interaction during the presentation of cultural heritage by professionals    2) investigate the structure of the texts contained in the collected corpus, in order to produce automatic approaches supporting text generation for oral presentations in cultural heritage domain    3) provide a reference computational model to support development of artificial agents exhibiting coherent, engaging behavioural strategies. In addition to the orality degree of the assembled presentations, special attention will be attributed to non-verbal aspects. Specifically, CHROME will concentrate on enriching the presentation with consistent prosody and gestures    4) evaluate the impact of these agents in simplifying access to cultural heritage and attract visitors in cultural sites    Five research groups will participate in CHROME. The equipe is highly interdisciplinary and is formed by linguists (with specific competences in prosody, pragmatics, paralinguistics, non-verbal behavior analysis), computational linguists and computer scientists (with skills in Artificial Intelligence and Human Machine Interaction). Objectives and tasks will be balanced across different competences and pursued in a strongly collaborative framework.

This requires a coherent scientific programme of characterization of the mitigation strategies in relation to the phenomena, to identify the most sustainable design. This research project is framed within such a programme and is intended to contribute to three essential actions for the landslide risk mitigation: 1) the monitoring of the landslide processes, 2) modelling the processes to identify the most appropriate remedial measures, and 3) the development of innovative design strategies. This research intends to devise a strategy for the diagnosis of landslide processes and their causes, both on the basis of the wide and diverse experience of the scientists involved in studying landslide phenomena in geologically complex conditions and through the combined use of advanced slope modelling and innovative monitoring technologies. The diagnoses will be trained on soil/rock slope case histories for which both field and laboratory data are available and representative of recurrent slope processes of important social impact. For soil slopes, the research will require coupled hydro-mechanical numerical modelling, including the geo-hydro-mechanical complexity typical of the most unstable natural slopes in mountain chain areas. For rock-falls, the research will address both the probabilistic calculation of the rock block dimensions and the longevity of the mitigation measures, which is still a major challenge of risk mitigation. Unconventional monitoring tools, making use of advanced technologies, will be developed and applied. Prototypes of fibre optic sensors will monitor straining within either landslide bodies or interacting structures. A sensor system will be tested for real time in-situ monitoring of the most relevant soil state variables. Also, advanced satellite techniques to monitor surface displacements (DInSAR) will be validated as an indicator of landslide activity, by comparing satellite data with ground measurements. Through the integration of the new and traditional monitoring data with the modelling results, the research will deliver advanced design of early warning systems. For climate driven landslides, the effectiveness of innovative drainage diaphragms and the use of high transpiration vegetation will be also tested. Based on chemo-mechanical coupled modelling, a chemical soil strength improvement respecting ecosystems will be tested as a stabilizing measure for clayey slopes. The products of this research will give not only an immediate benefit in the cost-effectiveness of stabilization works, but also will prompt the economies of landslide prone areas. There will also be the benefit to industry of rational and safe design, the methodologies of which could be exported to countries of similar landslide hazard.

It is a major challenge for Solid and Structural Mechanics to design and model microstructured materials and multifunctional composite systems for sustainable and smart structural applications and for the replacement of rare materials (EIP-Raw Materials-Horizon2020), within the biomedical, aerospace, mechanical and civil industries. It is known that microstructured and engineered composite materials with mechanical properties superior to those of natural materials can be developed exhibiting extreme mechanical performances (negative-Poisson ratio, ultra-stiffness, ultra-damping, temperature insensitiveness, super-toughness, super-strength). In this research field, the possibilities for designing and manufacturing new materials are endless. The development of these materials is however severely limited by the lack of theoretical and computational physically based models which accurately predict the mechanical behaviour, define safety limits and reduce expensive experimental tests. The use of these models would allow the optimization of the components and the development of products in line with strict reliability and safety standards, thus leading to an increase in industrial competitiveness.  The main objectives of this research project are to provide theoretical and numerical tools and to define experimental protocols for the prediction of the mechanical behaviour of innovative smart micro-structured materials and metamaterials, in the presence of multi-physics couplings like thermo, electro, opto mechanical. The main objectives will be pursued developing innovative multi-scale models and optimization approaches, considering different materials (metamaterials, Shape Memory Alloys (SMA), smart composites) and nano-and micro-structured devices (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS)).  The major expected results are: the formulation of new multi-physics models, new multi-scale approaches and new optimization techniques for smart materials and metamaterials; the optimized design of new micro-structured materials and metamaterials; the fabrication of prototypes at the micro and mesoscale.  The major targeted applications are: acoustic metamaterials for new elastic wave filters at the micro and macro scale; auxetic metamaterials for new actuating mechanisms in MEMS; ceramic metamaterials and porous SMA for protection against impacts and explosions; smart (nano)-composites with improved structural performances.  The six Research Units (RU) involved in the project have a long experience of common research and will pursue the project goals in a synergistic way, with strong interactions. The RUs will apply similar methodologies; models, theoretical and numerical approaches will be formulated in strict collaboration. Applications will be different for each RU ranging from micro to macro devices and structures.
100|grant.6852424|20158A9CBM|Geochemical and isotopic budget of highly metasomatised sub-continental mantle in the Africa and Europe geodynamic systems|Geochemical and isotopic budget of highly metasomatised sub-continental mantle in the Africa and Europe geodynamic systems|Mantle metasomatism is one of the main processes in the Earth’s dynamics. It governs the elemental (major, trace and volatile elements) and isotopic (radiogenic and stable) transfer among different geochemical reservoirs, being one of the main causes of the pronounced heterogeneity of the deep sources of mantle-derived magmas. Hence, deciphering mantle metasomatism is fundamental to understand the global cycle of many elements. Some of them, such as C, are relevant throughout the Earth system and fundamental to life.    Mantle metasomatism depends upon the formation of fluids/melts variably enriched in trace elements, their flux within and interaction with mantle rocks. Upon melting, heavily metasomatised continental mantle bodies produce extremely enriched magmatic compositions (i.e. various ultralkaline rocks including carbonatites) with peculiar geochemical and isotopic signatures, which can be used to unravel mantle metasomatic processes and the origin of metasomatic components.    This project will constrain the budget of key major/trace elements and isotopes involved in the genesis of highly metasomatised continental mantle domains, focusing on mantle-derived alkaline magmas, xenoliths, and fossil ultramafic massifs of Africa and Europe through a multidisciplinary approach, including:    a) the petrological, geochemical (major/trace elements) and isotopic (Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf-Os, U-series disequilibria, traditional and non-traditional stable isotope systems such as C, Mo, Tl and 238U/235U) studies of highly enriched magmas and their mineral components. We will study igneous rocks erupted both at destructive/collisional margins between the African and Eurasian plates and in within-plate settings, far from any active subduction process, with the aim of constraining the origin of the metasomatic components and their contribution to the mantle sources of magmas;    b) the petrological, geochemical (major/trace elements) and isotopic (Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf-Os) study of strongly metasomatised fossil mantle portions, either exhumed to the surface or entrained in magmas as xenoliths. We will focus on specific mineral phases that are the repositories of the metasomatic enrichment. In situ chemical and isotopic studies of minerals from mantle samples will be combined with crystal-chemical methods. The goal is to constrain the geochemistry and migration mechanisms of fluids/melts through the mantle and their emplacement at the crust-mantle boundary.    c) the detailed tectonic and paleomagnetic study of selected key areas, to reconstruct the nature and timescale of the main geodynamic processes that have governed the genesis and migration of metasomatic components and triggered mantle melting.    The obtained data will be merged into a coherent model of mantle metasomatism in continental mantle domains for different geodynamic settings that will put constraints on the budget of trace elements and isotopes cycled through the Earth’s mantle.

To this end, we will focus on a specific primary cardiomyopathy (CMP) caused by mutation of the nuclear lamina gene lamin A/C (LMNA), which will serve as a paradigm for studies on other cardiac pathologies. In fact we reasoned that, although patient-personalized medicine will possibly be applied in the future to other genetic diseases and, ultimately, to the general population to treat common disorders, focusing today on a monogenic disorder with a phenotype that is nonetheless quite varied is a feasible approach to generate significant information when considering constraints on resources and time.    Mutations of LMNA cause a heterogeneous group of disorders – the laminopathies – characterized by a spectrum of clinically distinct phenotypes: indeed, based on clinical manifestations, mutated LMNA-related diseases can be grouped into those that affect striated (cardiac/skeletal) muscle, adipose tissue (causing metabolic abnormalities) and peripheral nerves or multiple organ systems causing dramatically accelerated ageing (progeria). Cardiac involvement typically includes dilated CMP and life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias.    Thus, the specific aims are: 1) to deep-sequence CMP patients carrying LMNA mutations and their family members, in order to determine whether genomic variants in genes other than LMNA influence the clinical phenotype; 2) to profile patients’ circulating noncoding RNAs, in order to determine whether there are any specific signatures linked to diagnosis/prognosis; 3) to generate patient-specific cardiac cell lines via the use of induced-pluripotent cell (iPSC) technology, in order to define genotype–phenotype correlations and the role of epigenetics in the disease; and ultimately, 4) to develop bioengineered cell/tissue platforms through the combination of iPSC and microstructured-stamp technologies, and use them to study cardiomyocyte functionality in CMP and assess their suitability as drug-screening tools.    The members of our research team have internationally respected backgrounds in the fields of cardiac genetics, epigenetics and non-coding RNA biology, iPSC generation and differentiation towards the cardiomyogenic lineage, molecular electrophysiology, and bioengineering. Many members already have a well-documented history of collaboration, and the project sets up a new, strategic partnership between cardiac clinicians/biologists and bioengineers. The completion of the project by our team will produce a wealth of new information on the pathophysiology of LMNA-related CMP, furthering our understanding of this disorder. More importantly, reaching its objective may not only have the much-needed impact on the clinical management of this form of CMP, but will have implications for other pathologies too.

From the point of view of the dying person, analysis will be made of the places and organizational contexts in which the last phase of life is spent; from the point of view of the survivors, study will centre on when and with what frequency death is present in the experiences of Italians, how they cope with it, who takes care of the dying person, and who surrounds him/her. End-of-life farewell constitutes the second thematic area; analysed in this part will be funeral rites and ceremonies, the actors involved, including survivors and the funeral industry, the disposal of bodies after death, and burials. The third objective is to study loss, mourning, forms of communication and the construction of postmortem bonds with the deceased, the management of memory, its spaces and times. Finally analysed will be beliefs relative to death, the final stages of life, and the afterlife.  The research design will take account of four dimensions of analysis crucial for describing and understanding variations in experiences related to dying and death across different social groups and in different contexts. The dimensions identified and described in detail in the project proposal are the following: the territorial dimension, meaning both the region and the demographic size of cities; the position within the social stratification system, its levels of class and rank; gender; the generation of membership.  The research will be conducted using several methodological tools. First, a sample survey will be conducted using the CAPI method on a representative national sample of a size sufficient to ensure that bi- and multivariate analyses are possible. Second, in-depth interviews will be carried out in order to reconstruct experiences of mourning. These experiences will be collected within families conceived as survey units, so that the members of each family will be interviewed in order to maximize generational and gender variety. These two main sources will be flanked by interviews with key informants, analysis of secondary sources (statistical surveys, administrative sources), reconstructions of historical series of specific indicators, archival research, brief ethnographic surveys conducted in ceremonial settings (such as funerals and cemeteries)  and professional domains (funeral undertakers, cultural analysis of media products that deal with death and dying).

Light harvesting and ET in photosynthesis is a touchstone because it represents the most solid evidence that quantum phenomena, such as superposition of states (coherences) and quantum entanglement, really play a key role in biology. The striking efficiency of ET and CT in nature depends on ultrafast excited state dynamics including energy transfer and charge separation, where quantum superposition and coherence dynamics are crucial.   Very recently, few evidences of the relevance of quantum phenomena also in the dynamics of artificial systems have been provided. In this project, named Quantum Photovoltaics (Q-PV), starting from these evidences we want to make a step further and explore if and how quantum mechanics may affect the dynamics and the efficiency of ET and CT in hybrid nanosystems, potentially exploitable in real photovoltaics (PV) applications. The shift towards hybrid systems is necessary in order to translate the concept of quantum coherence from biological homogeneous systems (i.e. pigment-protein antenna complexes and analogous) where it was initially recognized, to real devices. One of the main challenges in the latters is the presence of interfaces. Q-PV will study how quantum coherence can be preserved at the interface, from the experimental and theoretical point of view. The final aim will be to understand if and how control quantum effects at interface and design new hybrid PV nanomaterials that can break the limits of classical physics.  To fullfill this aim in Q-PV we will make use of cutting-edge techniques in the synthesis of colloidal nanoparticles (oxide and quantum dots) with controlled size and shape and in their  functionalization with suitable organic chromophores to obtain hybrid nanostructured materials, properly designed to interact with each other by means of energy or charge transfer. We will characterize the mechanism and the degree of ‘quantumness’ of ET and CT at the interface with state-of-the-art coherent 2D and 3D ultrafast techniques. Finally, we will employ theoretical approaches at the forefront of the field to model the physical-chemical processes and suggest possible future directions in the systems’ design.

Tuttavia, può anche essere sintetizzato in maniera PLP-indipendente da parte della 3-mercaptopiruvato sulfurtransferasi (3-MST) e della cisteina amino transferasi. Esiste una correlazione positiva tra declino della funzione polmonare, diminuzione di CSE e CBS e livelli plasmatici di H2S in pazienti con Asma, BPCO e Ipertensione Polmonare. La capacità di neutralizzare specie reattive dell’ossigeno sicuramente contribuisce all’effetto benefico dell’ H2S. Comunque tale attività chimica diretta di quenching non spiega, per se, i suoi effetti benefici. Infatt,i bassi livelli di H2S regolano positivamente sistemi antiossidanti endogeni quali glutatione e le superossido dismutasi. In particolare l’ H2S attiva il gene Nrf2 che legandosi ad ARE (antioxidant responsive element) attiva “i geni antiossidanti”. Inoltre la modulazione delle caspasi intracellulari o chinasi costituisce  un ulteriore effetto additivo. Ulteriori meccanismi identificati per l’ H2S includono l’ inibizione del metabolismo cellulare, l’attivazione dei canali del potassio, l’inibizione delle fosfodiesterasi, la sovraregolazione di geni anti-infiammatori ( emoossigenasi 1 ) e la sottoregolazione di geni infiammatori (COX2, FOS, IL-1, IL-8, TNF-alfa). Lo scopo del progetto di ricerca è di chiarire il ruolo della via dell’ H2S nelle patologie polmonari ostruttive e restrittive. A tale scopo saranno utilizzate tecniche in vitro utilizzando sia cellule ottenute da lavaggi broncolaveolari di pazienti che  linee cellulari. Le tecniche  sperimentali in vivo, in modelli murini , permetteranno di separare gli effetti antiossidanti diretti da effetti collegati a modifiche di altre vie enzimatiche. In particolare saranno utilizzate linee cellulari geneticamente modificate, ceppi di topi sensibili e resistenti a stimoli ossidanti per studi in vivo ed ex vivo. La BPCO indotta da fumo di sigaretta o la fibrosi da bleomicina rappresentano  i modelli in vivo. Saranno utilizzati animali KO per CSE e 3MST, enzimi responsabili della produzione endogena di H2S. La generazione di un topo KO per eNOS e CSE sarà inoltre fondamentale per definire la possibile interazione con la pathway dell’ossido nitrico, notoriamente coinvolta nelle patologie polmonari. I risultati ottenuti potranno offrire un razionale per nuovi interventi terapeutici nella BPCO modulando la via metabolica dell’ H2S attraverso donatori di H2S a cinetica controllata, ibridi dei glucocorticoidi, budesonide e beclometasone. Infine lo studio cercherà di chiarire se e quale ruolo ha l’ H2S nel meccanismo d’azione di N-acetilcisteina e N-carbossimetilcisteina due farmaci comunemente utilizzati in terapia.

Attention will also be paid to questions arising from mathematical models for physical, engineering and medical problems. The analysis of related issues of functional analysis, mainly Sobolev type inequalities, and of convex analysis, specifically from the Brunn-Minkowski theory of convex bodies, also falls within the scopes of the present Project.    PDEs are studied under several respects and perspectives. One of the distinctive viewpoints of the present Project consists in focusing on their geometric aspects. Geometric tools will be exploited to discuss modern issues in the theory of boundary value problems and free boundary value problems for elliptic and parabolic (second and higher-order, local and nonlocal) equations. Geometric and qualitative features of solutions, such as location and structure of sets of critical points and of hot spots, and symmetries or convexity of their level sets, will be the object of investigations as well. Shape optimization, i.e. constrained minimization or maximization of functionals defined on geometric objects, such as eigenvalues of Euclidean domains or Riemannian manifolds, capacity of sets, elastic energy of curves falls within the scopes of the Project.    Existence, uniqueness and regularity problems for solutions to PDEs will also be investigated. Project researches will include: minimal domain and data regularity for gradient bounds for solutions to nonlinear elliptic and parabolic equations and systems; existence and uniqueness of “fundamental solutions” to fractional diffusion equations in various settings (weighted Euclidean space, Riemannian manifolds) and applications to asymptotics of general solutions; qualitative and quantitative properties of solutions to nonlinear second and fourth-order hyperbolic equations, also supported by discretization methods and computer assisted proofs.    These lines of research have close connections with the geometric-analytic inequalities to be studied in this Project. The relevant inequalities pertain to the theory of sets of finite perimeter and to the potential theory, and to the related theory of function spaces, especially of Sobolev type. The inequalities in the Brunn-Minkowski theory of convex bodies, and their functional counterparts, to be considered are crucial in certain questions in the theory of PDEs like those mentioned above, and, in turn, their study often benefits from PDEs techniques.    Although this Project is mainly of pure science, some of its proposed researches are strongly motivated by applications. For instance, medical diagnosis (geometric tomography of convex bodies), suspension bridges (nonlinear fourth-order hyperbolic PDEs), diffusion in porous media, fast diffusion (nonlinear degenerate or singular parabolic PDEs), hydrocarbons flow in pipelines (3d uncompressible Navier-Stokes equation).
100|grant.6851958|2015KT7HSJ|Mitigazione del rischio ambientale|Environmental risk mitigation|La cronaca italiana registra con insistenza «disastri naturali» di varia natura e intensità. È molto discutibile che questi eventi abbiano intensità e frequenza maggiori che in passato, ma i loro effetti producono danni crescenti: in vite, in costi sociali, patrimoniali, infrastrutturali e produttivi, in degrado ambientale e paesaggistico... La causa di questa tendenza è da individuare in una diffusa ignoranza delle dinamiche ambientali e territoriali, tra le cui manifestazioni alcune in particolare attengono al progetto di ricerca. Nel gestire il territorio: 1) non si considera adeguatamente il patrimonio documentario storico, ricco di informazioni su vulnerabilità e rischio, cui le istituzioni dei secoli scorsi davano molta attenzione; 2) non si considera adeguatamente l’insieme dei «saperi locali», competenze e conoscenze efficienti quanto la documentazione tecnico-scientifica; 3) non si considera adeguatamente l’impatto antropico sulle dinamiche ambientali/territoriali, come mostra la stessa definizione di disastro «naturale» attribuita a questi eventi: di qui, la sottovalutazione o la negazione di responsabilità e la rinuncia a (o la sfiducia in) misure di efficace mitigazione del rischio.  Su queste premesse, e su un necessario investimento preliminare in termini teorici e metodologici, il progetto mira a proporre un modello di analisi dei dati territoriali che agevoli, nel progettare/prevedere e nel gestire, la mitigazione dei rischi derivanti da eventi «naturali», la promozione dello sviluppo socio-economico e la tutela delle emergenze paesaggistico-culturali. Si intende analizzare, individuare e mobilitare operativamente dati geostorici e socioculturali, accanto a quelli attualistici di contesto, con cui delineare un «protocollo» analitico e conoscitivo utile alla pianificazione di interventi territoriali sostenibili e partecipati; e proporre coerenti modelli di analisi e rappresentazione dell’impatto delle pratiche di governance territoriale.  Sulla scorta di dati archivistici, bibliografici e cartografici, si mirerà ad approfondimenti specifici su aree diverse e significative scelte come esempi, tenuto conto dell’ampia varietà di situazioni territoriali e documentarie riscontrabile nel Paese. Si mirerà a ricavarne una tipologia unitaria delle fonti da indagare, nonché degli strumenti analitici da adottare, in un approccio multiscalare alla gestione del territorio e all’esame preventivo degli effetti degli interventi antropici. L’operazione comporterà la raccolta di dati di contesto sulle aree indagate, comprese le condizioni di rischio, da organizzare in database georeferenziati, e da restituire anche in forma cartografica. Fonti e banca dati serviranno a sviluppare un protocollo applicativo che funga da «saggio» metodologico: un «manuale» per valutare preventivamente le azioni di trasformazione e per individuare pratiche innovative.
100|grant.6851924|20159M7X5P|Transitivity and Argument structure in flux|Transitivity and Argument structure in flux|This projects aims at investigating transitivity parameters as affecting argument structure constructions and their development over time. To do this, we will combine different perspectives and methodologies in order to include language change, language reconstruction, and language typology in the light of current theorizing on argument realization and the encoding of the argument structure of verbs. In the first place, we will provide an extensive description of transitivity related phenomena in individual languages, notably Latin, Italian and other Romance languages, building on already available sources, enriched with a corpus-based study of the extent and limits of the variation encountered, both synchronically and diachronically, for a number of transitivity domains. More specifically, we will investigate the encoding and diachrony of voice systems, (in)transitive alternations (e.g. split intransitivity, object encoding, object omission, anticausative alternation, factitive constructions), non-finite syntax (e.g. the syntax of infinitives, gerunds  and past participles), providing an in-depth survey of the diachronic development of these transitivity domains and argument structure constructions in the transition from Latin to Romance. In the second place, we will compare argument structure constructions in ancient Indo-European languages, and discuss whether they may be etymologically related to each other, hence reconstructible for Proto-Indo-European, or whether they are the result of separate diachronic developments. Finally, the possible motivations for the development of individual argument structure patterns will be investigated in a broad typological perspective, by comparing different instances of this development across genetically unrelated languages, and by considering possible changes in argument structure and alignment patterns. As a result, we will provide a comprehensive picture of transitivity related issues, and provide better insights on their relation with argument structure constructions. 	  	An important aim of our research will also be to provide resources for research on transitivity and argument structure constructions, in the form of various types of databases and annotated corpora, along with the description of the methodologies employed to produce them. In this way, we pursue a two-fold purpose: in the first place, we will make new resources available for the scientific community, and in the second place we will provide for replicability of our results.   	Our project is embedded in current research on various aspects of transitivity and argument structure constructions. We will build on results reached by members of the research team in earlier projects, and are planning cooperation with a number of partner projects. This will magnify possible results and enhance their impact. As a last step, we also suggest some applicative uses of part of the envisaged results, which may have a socio-economic impact.

This phenomenon is mainly attributed to an antigenic stimulation that contributes to chronic inflammation and progressive changes in the T-cell and B-cell systems. These changes correlate also with a high prevalence of diseases of aging, as for Alzheimer disease (AD) and sarcopenia. Long-Lived Individuals (LLIs) delay or escape age-related disability and various age-related diseases likely due to the phenomenon of demographic selection leaving behind a cohort of selected survivors. These individuals have a favourable genetic profile that could disclose how genes, such as APOE and FOXO3A, influence aging and related diseases. Our on-going efforts include the recruitment of LLIs, their genetic and epigenetic characterization at genome-wide level, and the identification and initial characterization of a Longevity Associated Variant (LAV) in BPI Fold Containing Family B, Member 4 (BPIFB4) that enhances eNOS phosphorylation, endothelial function and migration. Furthermore, epigenetic variations, such as CpG methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNAs, may also be central to controlling changes in gene expression and genomic instability during aging. For this proposal, we plan: i) to potentiate the ongoing efforts on LLI population characterization, through the integration of pre-existing data with exome sequencing to identify common and rare genetic variants, and ii) to analyse mRNA and non-coding RNA expression profiles, as well as DNA methylation status, in mononuclear cells (MNCs) of de novo recruited LLIs and middle-aged-MACs (healthy, AD, and sarcopenic patients) and young (YCs) controls. In addition, the role of the inflammosome, the immune and vascular repair processes point at the need for functional characterization of CD34+ pro-angiogenic MNCs and T cells from de novo recruited LLIs, MACs and YCs. Finally, the new longevity variants identified by exome sequencing and epigenetic studies will be validated in vitro and in vivo in cardiovascular system. The goal of our collaboration is to identify genetic/epigenetic signatures associated with healthy aging and AD and sarcopenia in order to understand how they influence inflammosome, CD4+ and C34+ cells and protection from cardiovascular and immunological diseases. This will lead to a better understanding of the common mechanisms underlying age-related diseases and their relevance for co-morbidities.
100|grant.6851657|2015YYLBTR|La signoria rurale nel XIV-XV secolo|The rural lordship in the XIV-XV century|Il progetto di ricerca si propone di portare un contributo fortemente innovativo alla conoscenza dell’Italia tardomedievale (sec. XIV-XV) attraverso la riconsiderazione della diffusione e del ruolo della signoria rurale, intesa nelle sue più diverse forme. Gli studi scontano da questo punto di vista un gravissimo ritardo. Privilegiano il ruolo giocato dalla signoria nei processi costitutivi dello stato (sia a matrice cittadina che principesca),  trascurando la funzione dei signori nelle relazioni sociali e economiche, locali e sovralocali. Inoltre sottovalutano o ignorano la moltitudine di nuclei di potere signorile che costella le campagne della Penisola.  L’obiettivo è allora quello di restituire a tutto tondo la “pervasività” del potere signorile: sia in riferimento alla sua estensione, sia riguardo alla sua capacità di condizionare capillarmente tutti gli aspetti della vita locale, da quelli politici a quelli economici e sociali.   - Da un lato, si intende procedere ad una ricognizione ad ampio raggio al fine di accertare, nei diversi quadri regionali, l'effettiva diffusione del fenomeno signorile e le sue caratteristiche (tipologia dei poteri e dei signori, dimensioni dei nuclei signorili, ecc.). Verrà così superata l’immagine sommaria e spesso impressionistica attualmente disponibile.  - Dall’altro lato, mettendo a frutto i suggerimenti di una stagione recente e molto vivace di studi dedicati a questi temi per un periodo precedente (XII e XIII secolo), ci si propone di indagare tanto le diverse forme di potere signorile, quanto soprattutto il loro impatto sia sui soggetti politici (città, stati) con cui la signoria interagiva, sia sui diversi aspetti della vita locale (non solo quelli politici, ma anche quelli sociali: articolazione delle società rurali, mobilità sociale, vita dei rustici, matrimoni, eredità, pratiche religiose). In questa prospettiva, un’attenzione particolare riceveranno le dinamiche economiche, certo tra gli aspetti meno studiati, e la struttura delle fonti signorili.  Spazi politici, spazi economici, dinamiche sociali e pratiche documentarie costituiranno dunque i versanti di una ricerca che per ampiezza, aggiornamento metodologico e questionario da rivolgere alle fonti non ha precedenti nella medievistica italiana. Senza di essa, non v'è possibilità di giungere a un'adeguata comprensione della storia italiana tardomedievale.
100|grant.6851627|2015NXCPHB|Corpus dell'antico occitano|Corpus of the ancient Occitan|Il progetto è dedicato ai testi medievali occitani e alla loro ricezione antica ed ha due poli d’interesse tra loro complementari: i canzonieri manoscritti come recettori della lirica e di testi ad essa associati nella trasmissione (narrazioni biografiche in prosa, componimenti in metro narrativo-didattico), e, di contro, alcuni testi in prosa di natura diversa (didattici, devozionali, scientifici). Risultato principale sarà l'allestimento di un archivio testuale articolato su un doppio livello (trascrizioni diplomatiche e edizioni interpretative) e corredato da un potente sistema d'interrogazione. Suo costituente primario saranno le edizioni dei canzonieri; accanto ad esse, gli altri testi presi in esame nell’ambito del progetto, contribuendo per altro di per sé ad arricchire la documentazione disponibile per l’antico occitano, avranno il compito specifico di cominciare a definire un ‘corpus di riscontro e controllo’ rispetto alla tradizione lirica, valido soprattutto in prima battuta per il livello grafico-linguistico. Identica funzione di verifica contrastiva avrà il particolare sotto-corpus costituito dai testi lirici a tradizione extravagante, dei quali non è stata avviata, finora, un’analisi sistematica.  Edizioni integrali di canzonieri, di testi lirici a tradizione dispersa e di testi in prosa, verranno proposte in trascrizione diplomatica e in versione interpretativa. Tali edizioni, eventualmente stampabili in formato tradizionale, saranno:  1) leggibili direttamente in formato digitale (RIALTO : www.rialto.unina.it/)  e, per la lirica, agganciate, come elemento di consultazione, al repertorio dei testi (BEdT : www.bedt.it)   ma soprattutto  2) interrogabili immediatamente, terminato l'allestimento, sia nel formato diplomatico, sia in quello interpretativo, attraverso uno strumento avanzato come il software GATTO sviluppato dall'Opera del Vocabolario Italiano (http://www.ovi.cnr.it)  e in prospettiva, auspicabilmente,  3) integrate entro le concordanze complete della letteratura occitana medievale (COM) ideate da P. Ricketts e proseguite ora da D. Billy (concretamente il livello COM 3 per quanto riguarda la prosa e COM 4, ora allo stato di solo progetto, dedicato ai canzonieri)  4) integrate (le prose scientifiche) nel Corpus ReMediA (http://remediaweb.ovi.cnr.it/), corpus plurilingue di testi medici medievali.  Si propone di cominciare con i mss costituenti il nucleo della famiglia individuata con la sigla ‘epsilon’ (Avalle): i canzonieri siglati D-Da, A, B, H, N e gli antichi frammenti A', m e z, con il prolungamento occitano rappresentato da E e dal ‘Libre de Miquel de la Tor’ e con primi sondaggi sul ‘canzoniere di Bernart Amoros’, connesso con N e con A.   L'edizione digitale dei manoscritti verrà accompagnata da studi dedicati ai canzonieri, alla tradizione manoscritta, a singoli testi, che sfruttino i risultati anche parziali conseguibili attraverso lo sviluppo della ricerca e l'accompagnino con il necessario supporto filologico.

L’asse Health, Demographic Change and Wellbeing del programma Horizon 2020 indica tra le priorità azioni orientate al miglioramento della salute e del benessere; le sfide del work programme 2016-2017 riguardano la gestione dell’invecchiamento e la correzione degli stili di vita, mirati a prevenire patologie croniche.  Inoltre il bando Europe in a changing world – inclusive, innovative and reflective Societies- Prize for Social Innovation in Europe mira alla valorizzazione di beni e servizi per il miglioramento di fenomeni sociali collettivi. Secondo l'UE, salute e benessere sono strettamente integrati alla nozione di città sostenibile e sono incoraggiate azioni trasversali che rafforzino questi obiettivi coinvolgendo molteplici attori.      In quest’ottica si muove il progetto di ricerca, che vuole mettere in relazione la trasformazione urbana indirizzata alla sostenibilità con la prevenzione delle patologie croniche del XXI secolo, determinate da stili di vita inadeguati. Di fatto l'obesità, il diabete, le allergie e l'asma sono nuove epidemie, generate non da virus, ma in gran parte da ambienti e comportamenti inadeguati: inquinamento, sedentarietà, errata nutrizione. Ricerche in campo medico hanno evidenziato come condizioni ambientali che favoriscano il movimento e l’attività fisica degli esseri umani, stimolino il consumo energetico individuale e migliorino le performances cognitive. Appare evidente, dunque, che insistere sulla pedonalità e, più in generale, sulla mobilità dolce, debba essere una delle azioni situate al primo posto di una politica urbana che voglia coniugare sostenibilità, vita sana e benessere della popolazione, con evidenti ricadute anche sulla spesa sanitaria.     In questo quadro diventa essenziale capire come lo spazio urbano possa essere in grado di influenzare il nostro comportamento spontaneo, inducendo una vita attiva, dove il movimento sia parte degli spostamenti quotidiani e produca effetti positivi sulla salute. Al centro di questo studio, quindi, vi sono la conformazione e le qualità dello spazio urbano, le sue declinazioni morfologiche e le caratteristiche che deve avere la mobilità dolce, come strategie d’incentivazione all’attività fisica e al cambio di stile di vita.   Il gruppo di ricerca - formato da architetti, paesaggisti, esperti del trasporto urbano, biologi, medici e sociologi - intende affrontare, con un approccio transdisciplinare e innovativo, il tema delle relazioni tra mobilità lenta e benessere psicofisico, avendo come obiettivo ultimo la stesura di un “protocollo” di riferimento, esito delle diverse sperimentazioni su alcuni casi studio italiani. Il lavoro intende valutare le poche esperienze già in atto e allo stesso tempo indagare le nuove potenzialità.

A core group of Italian scientists, with a long standing experience in Neglected Tropical Diseases and Poverty Related Diseases (NTDs and PRDs), decided to create the LeishPlaSch Consortium to bring their knowledge and their efforts together with the aim of achieving substantial advancements in the discovery of novel therapeutic and/or preventive drugs against Plasmodium, Leishmania and Schistosoma, the pathogens causing malaria (a PRD), leishmaniosis and schistosomiasis (PRDs and NTDs, respectively).  There are three main arguments that constitute the rationale for the choice of the project’s target parasitic diseases:   -All 3 parasites develops in the human host plus an invertebrate host/vector and all - at some stage of their life cycle - reproduce and/or mature in the blood of the human host;  -There is evidence for multi-parasite activity of various drugs and molecules belonging to different chemical classes, e.g. artemisins exhibit activity on Plasmodium, Leishmania and Schistosoma;   -The epidemiology and control of all 3 diseases is influenced by socioeconomic conditions, malnutrition, population mobility, environmental and climate changes.  The goal of the proposal is to develop new, deployable products with targeted profiles against malaria, leishmaniasis and schistosomiasis, in particular by identifying new chemical entities appropriate for the pharmacological management of malaria, leishmaniasis and schistosomiasis.  The goals of the LeishPlaSch consortium are:   1-Identification of disease specific and/or multi-antiparasitic new lead compounds, including repurposing approaches;  2-Identification of compounds with multistage effects for the development of combination treatments including transmission-blocking activity;  3-Validation of novel targets for drug discovery, including a structural biology approach;  4-Advancement of understanding parasite biology and drug-related host parasite relationships, including the definition of modes of action, and identification of new target pathways.  LeishPlaSch Consortium will exploit the high scientific skills of Italian parasitologists, structural and molecular biologists, medicinal and natural organic chemists, biochemists, immunologists, and bioinformaticians. Most of the LeishPlaSch partners are active members of the Italian Malaria Network and already synergized their activities in EC funded projects such as FP6-AntiMal and BioMalPar, and FP7-EVIMalaR and InterMalTraining. The organization of the LeishPlaSch consortium is organized on 3 WPs, based on 3 main platforms: a Chemistry Platform, an Enzymatic  and a Phenotypic in vitro platform and in vivo screening Platform. All three WPs will combine their interdisciplinary efforts to identify, select and investigate the mode of action of novel antiparasitic compounds.

Ma le CM italiane si confrontano oggi con precise criticità: debole identità, limitata integrazione fra centro e periferia, crisi fiscale-finanziaria, crollo degli investimenti pubblici, nazionali e locali, crisi del settore edilizio.  Attraverso un approccio multiscalare – da un livello macroterritoriale e metropolitano fino al livello del quartiere – il progetto intende interpretare queste criticità e identificare le diverse risposte possibili in termini di strategie e strumenti d’azione. Si intende configurare un nuovo paradigma di policy urbana in termini di:  -	auto-organizzazione delle città e delle comunità locali: identità, partenariato fra pubblico e privato (ppp), partecipazione e pianificazione strategica;   -	federalismo fiscale, sussidiarietà e responsabilità fiscale locale;   -	resource efficiency, massima efficienza nell’uso delle risorse naturali, umane, di suolo e di energia,  -	economia circolare, rigenerativa e restaurativa dei materiali, delle risorse naturali, del patrimonio culturale, della conoscenza, delle risorse di socialità - in una parola, del “capitale territoriale”.  Obiettivi scientifici (e specifiche metodologie):  1.	Le CM italiane, i “centri ordinatori del territorio” di rango successivo e l’evoluzione della gerarchia urbana del paese; rapporto centro/hinterland 1991-2011.   2.	Valutazione statistica del profilo della rendita fondiaria e immobiliare dal centro alla periferia delle 10 CM, valutando l’intensità della frattura attuale al confine centro/hinterland.   3.	Fiscalità metropolitana e investimenti pubblici. Potenziali entrate fiscali autonome per il rilancio degli investimenti pubblici e possibili risposte, con regolamenti di finanza pubblica e nuove forme di ppp.   4.	Nuovi modelli di rigenerazione e sviluppo immobiliare, specie attraverso i risparmi sui costi energetici in diversi contesti metropolitani settentrionali.  5.	Le potenzialità del nuovo strumento di “agevolazione della partecipazione delle comunità locali per la valorizzazione del territorio” (art. 24 dello “Sblocca Italia”), per manutenzione di spazi pubblici, aree verdi, gestione rifiuti e “valorizzazione di una limitata zona del territorio urbano”. Elaborazione di Big Data grazie a un accordo Politecnico di Milano-IBM.  6.

The first aim of this project will be characterized the microbiota composition and pain threshold of these animals. Following, we will evaluate if administration of BUT or ω- 3/6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in VPA-treated WAG rats produce a more significant antiepileptic effect, nociception normalization and if reduce the hepatotoxicity. Evidence suggest that both butyrate and PUFA are able to reduce lipid accumulation at hepatic level, to prevent liver inflammation and steatosis8. There is a growing interest on BUT because its impact on epigenetic mechanisms could lead to more specific and successful therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of different diseases ranging from genetic/metabolic conditions to neurological disorders9. Neurotrophic factors such as glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and BDNF have been considered as possible mediators of the beneficial effects of HDAC inhibitors in different neurological disorders10,11. On basis of this, our aim will be evaluate the possible modification of microbiota by BUT in pregnancy WAG rats to evaluate its role in the development of epilepsy  (epileptogenesis) in the new born and related comorbidity.    1.

100|grant.6851288|2015LX8R43|Verso un catalogo sistematico generale del Museo Nazionale del Bargello in Firenze|Towards a systematic catalog of the National Museum of the Bargello in Florence|Uno tra i musei d’Italia più importanti e ricchi di opere d’arte di valore, il Bargello di Firenze, è tuttora privo, a più di 150 anni dalla nascita (1865), di un corredo di cataloghi scientifici degni di tale definizione. Gli unici strumenti del genere, approntati meritevolmente verso la fine del secolo scorso, pubblicano in modo completo collezioni senza dubbio significative del Museo (i sigilli; l’oreficeria sacra italiana; gli stemmi dell’antico Palazzo del Podestà, sede del Museo stesso; le placchette; le monete e medaglie italiane), ma non arrivano a coprire neppure la metà del patrimonio e, soprattutto, neppure un quarto della sua apparecchiatura espositiva. Inoltre, il Bargello non ha, così come del resto quasi tutti i musei pubblici italiani, una banca-dati digitale delle proprie raccolte da offrire alla divulgazione attraverso la rete; e al momento, in seguito alla recente Riforma Franceschini che lo ha incluso tra i venti grandi musei statali dotati di autonomia, il Bargello non possiede nemmeno un sito internet suo proprio.    Guardando alle croniche carenze catalografiche appena denunciate, ma anche alle potenzialità operative insite sperabilmente nella Riforma, questo PRIN intende occuparsi della catalogazione scientifica sistematica di una parte cospicua del Museo, con particolare attenzione alle raccolte più peculiari: le sculture in tutti i materiali, i bronzetti, gli avori, l’oreficeria civile, i dipinti, le miniature, i mosaici e gli smalti, provenienti tanto dai nuclei collezionistici fondativi (che risalgono al tesoro della corona granducale di Toscana) quanto dalle preziose donazioni private che arrivarono al Museo nei primi tempi della sua storia (in particolare la Carrand, 1889). Incoraggiato dal pieno consenso accordatogli dall’odierna Direzione del Museo appena ‘riformato’, questo PRIN mira dunque a proporre un nuovo modello di stretta cooperazione scientifica tra università e musei statali, annullando le barriere che fino a oggi li hanno tradizionalmente divisi, e incoraggiando il Museo a diventare esso stesso centro di ricerca e di ridistribuzione cognitiva.    Il lavoro, condotto con la massima completezza possibile di dati (metrici, tecnici, stilistici, iconografici, bibliografici), e secondo le più aggiornate forme della catalogazione museale riconosciute a livello internazionale, è affidato alla responsabilità di undici studiosi universitari, distribuiti tra quattro unità operative locali, i quali hanno ciascuno alle proprie spalle una lunga esperienza di ricerca in campi della storia dell’arte strettamente connessi con le raccolte del Bargello. Pur nella separazione formale tra i compiti delle varie unità, l’affiatamento tra tutti i componenti del PRIN garantisce una salda compattezza e condivisione interna dei risultati da far confluire nei volumi a stampa e nel catalogo telematico del Museo: e anche questa saldezza vuol essere un forte elemento di novità, almeno rispetto ai PRIN tradizionali di Storia dell’arte.

Redrawing the boundaries of citizenship in the First World War and its aftermath|The scientific core of this project is the study of the process of definition and re-definition of state, peoples and citizenship in two periods of crisis and transition that were also moments of construction of a new sense of belonging and of exclusion: the First World War and its aftermath. As critical moments of the mobilization of parts of the population and of the exclusion of others through violence and forced nationalization (including economic nationalization), the war and the revolutions it generated contributed to the re-definition of the criteria and concepts of citizenship and belonging. After the war, the collapse of empires and the creation of new successor states also brought about processes of re-definition of inclusion and exclusion, which impacted not only upon Europe but also upon the colonial possessions of the European empires, as well as upon international law.    The main aims of this research project are:     1. Contributing in an innovative way to the literature on the changing notion and practice of citizenship between the turn of the 19th century and the aftermath of the First World War;   2. Adding a chapter to the history of the involvement of civilians in the war;   3. Analyzing the population policies toward groups defined in terms of nationality, religion or ethnicity (enemy aliens, minorities, internal enemies);   4. Exploring the role played by economic nationalism in reshaping demographic and migration policies and property rights.    We intend to do these by:     1. Analyzing the way in which belligerent countries sorted out the dilemma between security and civil liberties, and between individuals and collective categories lumping together anyone belonging to them;  2. Exploring the impact and the legacy of the First World War on the discourses, notions and practices of citizenship;   3. Analyzing the “ethnic/national turn” that occurred during the war and in its aftermath in nationality laws and population policies looking in particular at the treatment of enemy aliens;   4. Analyzing the authoritarian turn in political economics of the countries involved in the discrimination of enemy aliens, especially regarding the prevalence of economic nationalism and collectivist ideologies, which breached the liberal private property system and shaped the redistribution of economic resources and welfare provisions in postwar Europe.    Adopting a comparative and transnational approach, the research will focus on the social, political, cultural and juridical construction of aliens, enemy aliens and citizens in Europe and North America; on the colonies and the dominions of the main European empires; on the process of convergence and divergence in the different belligerent countries’ policies and in their implementation; on the cross-fertilization and transfers among legal cultures; on the impact of the humanitarian catastrophe of the war in the appearance of new regimes of citizenship and property systems.

An interpretative database of the Greek and Roman mythical lore is designed as a systematic online digital interpretative book of Greek and Roman mythical tales. PROTEUS takes its start from the project “Mythical lore. An anthropology of ancient myth”, funded by the MIUR (PRIN 2010/11).  This project is methodologically rooted in the belief that myth is capable of conveying models of thinking and patterns of behaviour particularly important for the cultures that devised, elaborated and transformed it over time.  The myths will be arranged into four thematic categories.  1. The individual  2. The community  3. The world  4. The gods  These categories will be composed of subcategories (all of them subdivided into the twin sections Greece / Rome): the first category will include the subcategories Birth, Life, Death, Name, Gender, Emotions, Character, Health and Illness; the second category will include the subcategories Kinship, Family, Towns and states, Political institutions and laws, Economy, War, Communication; the third category will include the subcategories Animals, Plants, Minerals, Space and Time; the fourth category will include the subcategories Theogony; Worship; Festivals; Divination; Sacrifice; Prayer; Magic; Purification; Oath; Dream; Underworld.  The expected results of PROTEUS encompass:  1. the diffusion of classical culture at every level, thanks to the creation of an open-access resource which will result in a user-friendly, free, innovatively organized, scientifically state-of-the-art, interactive and thought-stimulating online database of Greek and Roman mythical tales;  2. the promotion of the use of digital tools in a field of study where the role of online resources is still underestimated;  3. the consolidation of a network of scholars whose long lasting cooperation has given so far significant outcomes;  4. the possibility to fund the research activities of JRFs and Post-docs who already have developed an expertise, and revealed excellence, in the study of the ancient myths.  The Units will work under the leadership of M. Bettini, whose scientific production has long centred on the significance of myth for the comprehension of the ancient cultures and societies.  PROTEUS will overturn the perspective adopted by the traditional mythological repertories, since it will provide a panoramic view of the themes of cultural importance emerging out of the Classical mythical stories, by allowing the user to read in the website all the sources relevant to a certain myth. The Italian and English translations of these sources will make the database available for all the users in the world, while promoting the excellence of Italy in this scientific subfield.   The global outcome of the PROTEUS project will be the creation of an indispensable tool for understanding the origins of our civilization, contributing to the establishment of a shared European culture, by allowing its users to rediscover the common basis of this culture.

The most critical aspects regards:  • 14nmfinFet technology: 14nmfF will be used in one of the first research activities. This 3D-CMOS technology strongly differs from previous bulk-CMOS ones. Having novel transistor structures and behavior, and novel Layout Dependent Effects (LDE), require novel design strategies  $IMM_PER_0015  • Benchmark design case (see figure): SAW-less LTE transceiver with SCFD concept has never been realized before for implementation difficulties, nonetheless SCFD yields a 2x spectral efficiency increase. Challenging specs for SCFD implementation require advanced system solutions  $IMM_PER_0025  • C&S design innovation: 14nmfF solutions (included in the Radio-Frequency front-end (RF), Analog Mixed Signal baseband (AMS), Digital and Power Management (PM) blocks) will strongly exploit the interaction between the different sections of the transceiver, since the only way to satisfy the critical SCFD specifications (in particular its linearity and power consumption) demands the development of a global strategy that merges all the system features and leverages their potentialities. Adopted CAD optimization procedure will exploit specifically developed tools  • Overall power consumption optimization: target for both signal processing and PM blocks. The latter appear to be the bottleneck in 14nmfF, as a consequence advanced SC DC-DC converter will be designed to power the full transceiver and demonstrate the achievable performance and its robustness    ANIThiNG results will be:  • the realization of high-performance devices in aggressive 14nmfF, suitable for future massive applications such as IoT  • the 1st implementation of a SAW-less LTE transceiver that implements the SCFD concept This will result in a board simplification (with BoM reduction) and a doubling of the bandwidth efficiency  • the confidence gained with the use of 14nmfF, will create a new level of competence in the Italian research community that can be extremely advantageous for future research endeavors  • the development of innovative C&S (co-)design techniques available also for other research activities    ANIThiNG Units (MiB, NA, & PV) have:  • outstanding CVs  • experience with prototypes in 28nm CMOS or below  • experience in advanced wireless transceiver development  • experience in successful research industrial collaborations    ANIThiNG costs will be mainly (>60%) dedicated to the 4 3-years full-time researchers grants (one for each research activity: RF, AMS, Digital, and PM) and to the extremely expensive 14nmfF silicon fabrications (each pgtape will cost >125k€), addressing to these costs part of the overhead
100|grant.6850025|2015B7M39T|Useful experimental models for dissecting the molecular links between cancer development/progression and the obesity epidemic|Useful experimental models for dissecting the molecular links between cancer development/progression and the obesity epidemic|Overweight and obesity are health problems of epidemic proportions, associated with increased cancer risk and worse patient prognosis, but mechanisms underlying this complex relationship are still unclear. The present proposal aims to understand the molecular link existing between obesity and different types of solid tumors by using appropriate research tools for identifying novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to improve clinical outcomes. The dysfunction of adipose tissue in obese patients produces a state of chronic-low grade inflammation in tumor microenvironment relied on alteration of adipokine balance, with increased leptin secretion, along with an abundance of proinflammatory cytokines secreted by locally-recruited macrophages. These events are mirrored by molecular changes and cellular signature in peripheral blood. By generating transgenic mice wherein leptin receptor ablation is restricted to mammary epithelium, it will be assessed preclinically the relevance of leptin signaling in breast tumor biology. From a clinical point of view, an extensive molecular characterization of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating cancer-associated macrophage-like cells (CAMLs), which have a role in tumor dissemination, will be performed in breast cancer patients. This peripheral cell signature will be correlated with metabolic profiles before and after specific adjuvant therapy. Adipose tissue dysfunction has also a crucial impact in prostate cancer. Recently, various nuclear receptors have gained attention in regulating pathophysiology of obesity-related disease states. In vitro and in vivo models will be used for identifying the function of androgen receptor/FilaminA complex in prostate cancer spreading. This complex will be also monitored in CTCs isolated from normal, overweight and obese patients and CTC interaction with CAMLs will be analyzed. Moreover, the role of estrogen receptor β in mediating the antitumor effects of natural vitamin E-derived tocotrienols in obesity-related prostate cancer cell metabolism and progression will be evaluated. The role of leptin will be investigated in thyroid cancer, whose incidence is linked to obesity, using primary cultures obtained from various tumor tissues in which selective leptin inhibitors will be tested after encapsulation in novel nanovesicular carriers. The relevance of obesity-related cytokines and nuclear receptor signaling, as potential therapeutic targets, will be evaluated in rare head and neck paragangliomas by primary cultures and xenotransplant models. Finally, the evaluation of obesity-related pathway alteration will be assessed in hepatocellular carcinoma, of viral, alcoholic or metabolic origin, both in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tumor tissues.   All these findings by dissecting the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the association between obesity and malignancy may be important for the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies for cancer.
100|grant.6849958|2015PA5MP7|CALCOLO DELLE VARIAZIONI|CALCULATION OF VARIABLES|This research proposal deals with a variety of problems of theoretical and applicative interest, of stationary type (energy minimization, even with multiple scales and with competing volume and surface energies) and of evolution type. The common thread to all these problems is the use of classical techniques, as well as their more recent improvements, coming from Calculus of Variations, Measure Theory and Regularity Theory for PDE's. Often a technique developed in one context can surprisingly be very useful also in another one. Recent examples of this phenomenon are the use, by team members, of the theory of gradient flows for the development of a robust and very powerful differential calculus and the theory of synthetic Ricci bounds in metric measure spaces and the use of regularity theory and optimal transport in the proof of quantitative functional and geometric inequalities. These motivations led to the present composition of the team, made by renowned experts with complementary expertise, a consolidated collaboration experience even across research units and a great experience in the organization of research meetings and schools. The key research topics are:    A. EVOLUTION PROBLEMS. Analysis and classification of self-similar solutions to the Ricci flow, evolution of planar networks of curves. Variational and entropy methods for evolution problems: phase field systems and nonlinear diffusions, variational formulation of maximal monotone operators. Minimization and evolution of nonlocal functionals and of anisotropic functionals. Evolution of material defects, as plasticity, damage, and fracture.    B. FUNCTIONAL INEQUALITIES AND OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS. Stability of minimizers of isoperimetric problems and of minimizers of free discontinuity problems. Variational methods in the study of information, Sobolev and Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities. Spectral optimization problems.    C. GEOMETRIC MEASURE THEORY. Minimal surfaces in Carnot groups and in general metric measure structures. Structure of optimal clusters and the emergence of regular patterns. Regularity of anisotropic perimeter minimizing sets. Uniqueness of blow-up limits.    D. OPTIMAL TRANSPORT AND APPLICATIONS. Synthetic Ricci lower bounds for metric measure structures, limits of Riemannian manifolds and curvature operators on metric measure spaces. Multi-marginal optimal transport problems and transport problems with martingale constraint. Optimal networks in urban transportation.     E. PROBLEMS WITH MULTIPLE SCALES. Variational models with multiple scales related to dislocations, and rigidity results for two-phase planar maps. Anisotropic surface energies arising from limits of spin systems.    F. REGULARITY THEORY FOR ELLIPTIC AND PARABOLIC PDE's. Nonlinear and quasilinear elliptic equations and systems with singular and nonsingular lower order terms. Regularity of solutions to PDE's with nonstandard growth conditions.

Existing data on the incidence and prevalence of Pituitary Adenomas (PAs) are scanty and discordant. PAs are associated with clinical symptoms as a consequence of either hormonal excess or deficiency release, local mass effects particularly in giant adenomas or both. Different medical therapies for PAs are currently available, but their effectiveness in term of control of hormonal hypersecretion and/or tumor mass represents again a challenge in clinical endocrinology. The main targets of pharmacological treatment of PAs are the SS receptors (SST) subtype 2 and 5 (for GH-secreting and ACTH-secreting) and DRD2 (for PRL-secreting and, to a lesser extent for NFPAs), but a subset of patients is resistant to these drugs: 30% of patients with acromegaly and 10% of patients with prolactinoma to SS analog and dopamine agonist (DA), respectively, while most NFPA are unresponsive to both drugs. The molecular events involved in SS/DA resistance are not fully understood. Cushing’s disease (CD) express all SST receptors (SSTRs) and pasireotide (SS analog with high affinity for all SSTRs), inhibits ACTH secretion in human ACTH tumors and reduces cell proliferation in mouse ACTH-secreting cells. Moreover, recent evidences of a negative correlation between therapeutic targets expression and drug resistance have been reported, and for several of such targets an uORFs-affecting polymorphisms (puORFs) have been documented. PAs and therapies for their care, can induce different pituitary-disease related syndromes. CD and Acromegaly (A) are associated to a severe myopathy mainly affecting limbs and related to type-2 fibers atrophy, and of type 1 hypertrophy and atrophy of type 2 muscle fibers, respectively. Increased cardiovascular mortality and altered bone health is described in patients with GH deficiency (GHD), A and CD due to PAs, but few data are present in literature regarding diagnostic approach to evaluate cardiac morphology and bone quality in pituitary diseases. The general aims of the project will be focused on epidemiological, biological and clinical issues in pituitary genetic and tumorigenesis, effectiveness of and resistance to pharmacological treatment, when needed, success rate for obtaining a complete tumour surgical resection in problematic adenomas, rate of recurrence, impact of co-morbidities of the skeletal muscle, cardiac function and bone health in patients with PAs and related pituitary syndromes. Through basic and clinical studies, the researchers of the different UNITS will reach the aims proposed, creating an innovative network of cooperation.

Both types of proxies provide at best estimates of mean annual SSTs of open ocean settings. In order to better understand the dynamics of Cretaceous global warmth and the impact of exceptionally high SSTs on carbonate platform production, information on shoal-water SST evolution and associated seasonality patterns are required. Well-preserved low-Mg calcite shells of rudist bivalves hold a strong potential to act as archives for the reconstruction of Cretaceous palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental conditions. Sclerochemical analyses of ontogenetic isotopic and trace element variability in rudist shells also resolve sub-annual (seasonal) temperature fluctuations. The proposed project aims at reconstructing the temporal and spatial evolution of shallow-marine subtropical SSTs from a stratigraphically well-constrained Cenomanian-Turonian carbonate platform setting in the southern Apennines (Italy) based on rudist bivalve sclerochemistry. In order to cover a broad climatic range, the project will both focus on hothouse conditions during the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event (CTBE) as well as transient cool episodes such as the Mid-Cenomanian Event (MCE) and the Plenus Cold Event. In contrast to single-proxy approaches, the integration of established palaeotemperature proxies such as oxygen isotopes and Mg/Ca ratios with the novel carbonate clumped isotope (CCI) thermometer will help to identify potential discrepancies between different palaeotemperature reconstructions and to critically assess the extremely warm open-ocean temperature estimates derived from TEX86. High-resolution sclerochemical analysis of rudist shells for oxygen isotopes, Mg/Ca and CCI, moreover, will enable to thoroughly constrain Cenomanian-Turonian SST changes and associated variations in SST seasonality. By means of a combined oxygen-isotope and CCI approach, stratigraphic changes in the oxygen isotopic composition of Cretaceous seawater are going to be reconstructed. This allows testing the hypothesis of transient build-up of polar ice during cool episodes such as the Plenus Cold Event. The salinity component of oxygen-isotope signatures stored in rudist shells will be as well extracted by the means of multi-proxy sclerochemistry (oxygen isotopes, CCI, Mg/Ca). The reconstruction of salinity signals across a proximal-distal carbonate platform transect will in turn help to decipher the potential role of highly saline platform top water masses on organic matter preservation in deeper basins during times of peaking SSTs.

TLR4 is an emerging molecular target related to an impressively broad spectrum of modern day disorders still lacking specific pharmacological treatment. These include autoimmune disorders, chronic inflammations, allergies, asthma, infectious and CNS diseases and cancer.  The short-term scientific objective is to develop novel, non-toxic, synthetic and natural TLR4 modulators (agonists or antagonists) and to assess their therapeutic potential on animal models of TLR4-related acute and chronic pathologies that still lack efficient pharmacological treatment. The long-term scientific objective is to develop a new generation of innovative, TLR4-based therapeutics, to be used as vaccine adjuvants, anti-sepsis agents, and anti-inflammatory agents to treat chronic inflammations (allergy, asthma). The training programme will provide Early Stage Researchers (ESR) with broad competences, experience and skills in the cutting-edge, inter-disciplinary research in the field of chemical biology related to the molecular mechanisms of innate immunity and inflammation. During the training, the young researchers will be supported by senior scientists to cultivate their scientific, entrepreneurial and inter-cultural mindset. The non-academic sector will be committed to provide ESRs with entrepreneurship and company management skills, in order to enhance their employability by the private sector or even to motivate them to create own start-up companies.

Taking into consideration the complex skills needed by the aerospace sector, the action will develop the required learning outcomes and competence profiles for aero-engineering curricula and propose the aerospace specific accreditation criteria that would complement the existing European, national or regional accreditation systems for engineering education. The action will be developed in three distinct phases. The first phase is a conception phase. The learning outcomes and procedures will be defined looking at current practices and involving the main stakeholders of the higher education chain, from Universities to Industries and Research Establishments. The result should be a staged accreditation system, thereby gradually enhancing the quality level of the higher education degrees. The second phase is an implementation phase. The identified processes are tested on 6 aerospace curricula, from different EU countries. The third phase is a refinement phase. The results of the testing phase are compared to the expectations and the processes are updated taking into consideration the lessons learned from the testing phase. Suggestions for harmonizing the curricula and simultaneously developing knowledge and emerging technologies as well as facilitating students’ exchanges across the EU will be proposed. In parallel to the three phases, a dissemination and outreach activity is implemented to diffuse the culture of best practices among the EU higher education courses in the area of aerospace engineering and attract talented students to such studies. The consortium members include representatives of aerospace industry, research establishments and education institutions, participating in the major existing EU networks such as PEGASUS, EASN, ENAEE, EREA and EACP.
100|grant.3862114|BB/L02229X/1|Investigating the stability and function of i-motif DNA|Investigating the stability and function of i-motif DNA|"It is assumed that DNA exists as a double helix, the structure first described by Watson and Crick in 1953. However, it is lesser-known that DNA can adopt many different types of structure. DNA is composed of four different ""building blocks"" called bases: adenine, guanine, thymine and cytosine. DNA sequences rich in cytosine can form alternative secondary structures called i-motifs, first discovered in 1993. Sequences of this type are widespread throughout our genome and may play a role in gene expression, but there are many fundamental questions unanswered. The stability of i-motif structures is highly dependent on the particular sequence of bases. To understand which sequences are more likely to form i-motifs in biology, an understanding of their stability is required. This project proposes a systematic investigation of a library of different DNA sequences to determine the optimum sequence requirements for stable i-motif formation. This will allow us to define rules to predict the stability of i-motif structure based on the type of DNA sequence. We will then use this information for computational analysis of the human genome to estimate the number of sequences which could potentially form i-motif structures, and where these reside in the human genome. Using a mixture of molecular biology techniques, we will investigate the impact of stabilisation of i-motif structure on transcription and de-convolute the interplay between the dynamics of i-motifs and G-quadruplexes (structures which have previously been well-characterised) on gene expression. This proposal will reveal which i-motif sequences are most stable and potentially new targets for drug design, therapeutics and structural investigation.  Technical Summary This proposal is about the investigation of the stability and potential biological functions of i-motif DNA secondary structures. The project will use a range of biophysical and molecular biological techniques to answer the following key questions:  1) Which types of DNA sequences form the most stable i-motif structures?  2) How does epigenetic modification change the stability and dynamics of these structures? 3) Can targeting i-motifs with small molecule ligands interfere with gene expression?  4) Is there any interplay between the position of i-motif and G-quadruplex structures and the effects on gene expression and are there any synergistic effects between them?  Biophysical analysis will be performed on C-rich DNA libraries. UV melting and annealing experiments will be used to determine the thermal stability of the structures and insight into the kinetics of folding/unfolding processes. UV thermal difference spectroscopy will provide indicative spectra to characterise the type of DNA secondary structure formed. CD spectroscopy will provide further insight on the type of secondary structure in solution and will be used to determine the transitional pH of the sequence to give an indication of the pH dependent stability of the structure. Footprinting will be used to give insight into folding and topology. In vitro analysis will be performed using an RNA polymerase stop assay to indicate whether DNA secondary structures disrupt transcription. In vivo methodology will include cloning of plasmids for a luciferase based reporter gene assay for assessment of the effect of DNA secondary structure on transcription. Further experiments will utilise quantitative real time PCR, which measures the quantity of mRNA produced from chromosomal DNA. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments will be investigated using previously characterised i-motif and G-quadruplex interacting ligands as chemical tools."
100|grant.5146669|GGP14002|Developing peptides pharmacologically active for the most frequent Wilson disease-causing ATP7B mutant|Developing peptides pharmacologically active for the most frequent Wilson disease-causing ATP7B mutant|Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive Copper (Cu) toxicosis associated with Cu accumulation in the liver. This build-up of Cu causes death of the hepatocytes, the release of Cu, and its accumulation in extra-hepatic tissues, including the central nervous system. When untreated, death can result from liver failure. The gene defective in WD encodes ATP7B, a Cu-transporting protein primarily expressed in the liver.ATP7B changes intracellular localization in response to Cu levels. Under normal Cu levels, ATP7B resides within the trans-Golgi network (TGN), where it pumps Cu into the TGN lumen for incorporation into newly synthesized cuproenzymes, ferroxidase and ceruloplasmin. On increased Cu levels, ATP7B redistributes to the surface of the bile canaliculi of the cells and participate in the physiological Cu excretion into the biliary flow.The most frequent ATP7B mutation, H1069Q (40%-75% in the white population), results in a transporter protein with residual Cu transfer activity but accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and impaired in the Cu-dependent trafficking from the TGN. The mutation alters the structure of the protein resulting in a limited misfolding, and eventually the mutant ATP7B is not exported from the ER to the TGN.Thus, an apparently limited misfolding of ATP7B-H1069Q causes this form of WD.We have recently found that the protein chaperone CRYAB rescues folding, transport to the TGN and response to Cu overload of ATP7B-H1069Q in cultured cells. In this project, we will attempt to reproduce these results with small peptides derived from CRYAB and/or ATP7B and to validate them in in hepatocytes obtained differentiating staminal cells generated from fibroblasts of patients homozygous for the H1069Q mutation.The identified peptides would have a potential strong pharmaceutical interest, being suited to be developed to obtain a druggable molecule to specifically target hepathocytes harboring the H1069Q mutation.

SMARTBEES unites a team of experts with the necessary skills to build a bright and sustainable future. The SMARTBEES concept is low risk and high impact, using established protocols and state-of-the-art methods. Including world leading researchers from outwith the traditional honeybee sphere (e.g. acarology, genetic breeding and insect immunology). We will identify crucial facets of honeybee resistance to colony losses, Varroa and viruses. We will provide a step-change in the current mechanistic understanding of these traits, and will characterise the genetic background of the resistance mechanisms in honeybees. We will develop breeding strategies to increase the frequencies of these valuable traits in local honeybee populations, considering the variable need of both common and endangered subspecies and local beekeeping practises. Breeding efforts concentrating on very few races may endanger genetic diversity, to avoid this SMARTBEES will promote multiple local breeding efforts, to conserve local resilient populations and will develop molecular tools for describing and safeguarding future populations. SMARTBEES recognizes responsibility to protect our natural honeybee heritage. SMARTBEES will commission extension science, and work in cooperation with stakeholders to attain conservation by utilisation. SMARTBEES will establish a network of apiaries for performance testing, to encourage local uptake of resistant traits. These will be run mainly by beekeepers, thereby improving the local acceptability and dissemination, and support the long-term sustainability of the apicultural sector. SMARTBEES recognises the need to horizon scan for new threats, and the consortium includes the current EU reference laboratory to that end. SMARTBEES is an opportunity to make a lasting difference to the health, resilience and genetic diversity of our honeybees.
100|grant.3861392|EP/M002802/1|Communicating and evaluating cyber risk and dependencies|Communicating and evaluating cyber risk and dependencies|Industrial computer-based control systems are crucial to society, they control the water we drink, the power we use, the cars we drive as well as railways and air transportation. These systems need to be trusted and trustworthy. They are often networked into complex and interconnected systems of systems and control and protect the UK national infrastructure.    An important aspect of infrastructures is their interactions and interdependencies: the functioning of one infrastructures service often depends on the functioning of another. As the infrastructure becomes layered and there are secondary services layered on top of these primary infrastructures and as the network becomes dynamic and controlled by computer networks and systems there is considerable potential for unforeseen interaction and dependencies.    As Industrial control systems become more networked, the previous strategy of making them secure by isolating them from the world becomes ineffective. In addition those who might harm the system either out of maliciousness or misplaced curiosity proliferate and their expertise increases, so the importance of security for the availability and integrity of services and systems is becoming ever more significant.    The research focuses on the importance of dependencies and interdependencies in this security context. These have been studied for a number of years and it is known that unforeseen interdependencies are a source of threat to systems and an important factor in our uncertainty of risk assessment, particularly risk due to cascade failures in which the rate and size of loss is amplified.    However there two faces to interdependencies, while we are concerned about how they might make attacking the system easier and a source of unforeseen behaviours, it is also central to providing tolerance to attack and failure. Redundancy, diversity, defence in depth are deliberately engineered into control systems to increase dependability and are an important mechanism for adaptation and overall resilience.    Any risk assessment of computer based control systems has to take into account uncertainty about the structure of the system. It is not just the uncertainty of when events might happen but uncertainty about the world, so-called epistemic uncertainty. For example, audits for the US DHS states that they find, on average, 11 unexpected connections between the SCADA system and the enterprise network for each audit  A key part of risk assessment is communication to stakeholders and society as appropriate. We will develop a security informed (or cyber-informed) enhancement to evaluating and communicating business and other risks from lack of control system integrity and availability based on a claims, arguments, evidence (CAE) framework. Our focus will be to include cyber informed dependency analysis within these assessments. The research to do this will follow an impact driven, threat-informed and vulnerability-focused strategy.    We will also develop probabilistic models that address explicitly the evolving relationship between an adversary and attacks on the one hand and of the consequences of a successful attack as well as the dependencies between the mitigations and barriers. We are particularly interested in modelling and evaluating defence in depth as a fundamental part of any resilient and trustworthy system yet estimating its effectiveness given uncertainties in the system structure and the attack space is enormously difficult. We will develop a modelling toolset based on existing tools we have developed within EU, Artemis and TSB projects that integrate stochastic and deterministic (e.g. of power flow). We will conduct case studies based on problems provided by our project partners Adelard (a specialist SME that evaluates ICS systems and components) and Alsthom.

FSHD is characterized by progressive, asymmetric atrophy and weakness of a highly selective set of muscle groups, with wide inter- and intra-familial variability of clinical expression. The disease has been linked to reduction of D4Z4 repeat units on chromosome 4q35. It has been proposed that D4Z4 reduced alleles (DRA) must be associated with specific haplotypes to cause FSHD. However, the studies performed on Italian National Registry for FSHD (INRF, www.fshd.it), that has been established in 2007 by Italian Clinical Network for FSHD (ICNF), showed that 1.3% of healthy subjects from general population carry this molecular signature and that probably additional factors might be necessary to develop FSHD. The large collection of FSHD in the Italian Registry demonstrates the impact of the disease and provides a valuable resource for research. The aim of this Italian multicenter project will be: to classify FSHD patients and families in homogeneous sub-groups on the basis of phenotypic and genetic features; to investigate the natural history of the disease through the prospective clinical evaluation of patients; to seek modifier loci or new genes through whole exome sequencing and candidate gene approach. The Research Group expect to provide useful tools for diagnostic assessment and clinical care, supporting genetic counseling and prognosis in FSHD. The accurate description of clinical features will constitute the basis for future research aimed at increasing the understanding of clinical and genetic complexity of FSHD and at identifying outcomes of interests for patients and clinicians to be used in clinical trials.

We are developing a CMT National Registry, in the context of an International Registry, where we will collect clinical and genetic information on CMT disease and measure disease severity. There are many unresolved questions in the management and care of subjects affected by CMT. There is uncertainty about: disease course during pregnancy; prescription, perceived benefits and tolerability of foot orthotics and assistive devices; indications and results of surgery for skeletal deformities; safety for CMT people of general and local anaesthesia; occurrence of sleep disorders in CMT (which might be a cause of somnolence and fatigue). We are developing dedicated questionnaires to investigate all these aspects, through a formal process of generation of questionnaires which involves experts in the different implicated fields and the patients themselves, to select the items most meaningful for physicians and patients. We will also use already validated scales in the Italian language whenever available to investigate some aspects (scale assessing use of orthotics, foot pain, sleep, fatigue, anxiety and depression). Participants in the CMT National Registry will be asked to fill these self-reported questionnaires. We aim at collecting questionnaires from 500 affected subjects. Data will be then analyzed and will be important to give advice about pregnancy, orthotics, surgery, anaesthesia, sleep and fatigue in CMT. In the process of generating clinical measures to be used for clinical trials, we will also validate the Italian version of a scale of Quality of Life specific for CMT children (pCMTQoL) and administer it to Registry participants. It is important to define which is the best management and care of people with CMT, but there is a lot of work to do with this respect. This project aims at gaining information important for defining needs, disease burden and standards of care for CMT.

Uncertainties over mineral P supplies coupled with concerns for food security and environmental impact of P on waters all necessitate an improvement in agronomic P efficiencies, based on sound knowledge of the range of P forms in soils. Our research is different to previous approaches to recover P from soils in that it focuses on the organic P (Po) components and uses a novel combination of root exudates from different plants to solubilise organic P and make it bioavailable as inorganic orthophosphate.  The two fundamental problems associated with the use of soil organic P by plants are that much of it is strongly attached to soil particles and therefore inaccessible to plants, and secondly, even when not firmly attached to soil particles, the forms in which it exists are not readily available for plant uptake. Some plants possess traits that can help access organic P in soils; firstly some plants can produce organic acids from their roots, which can release the P attached to soil particles, and secondly some can release phosphatases (e.g. phytase), which can hydrolyse the organic P into forms which plants can take-up. However, crop plants generally do not possess both these traits and so combinations of plants are required, each carrying out a different role. Systems that rely on clover undersown into cereal crops to provide nitrogen (N) to the current crop, act as an overwinter green manure, and to provide N to following crops are fairly common in organic farming enterprises. We have clover lines which can produce phytase required to mineralize organic P, while some strains of barley have been shown to release organic acids, making the organic P available for mineralisation. We will investigate a clover/barley bi-cropping system as an exemplar sustainable alternative to intensive applications of P and N fertilizers, thus potentially making the arable system more efficient both economically and environmentally. Thus we shall test the overarching hypothesis that: Cropping systems with roots exuding both organic acid anions and phytase can facilitate more sustainable agricultural production by accessing soil organic P forms.   Specifically, we propose to investigate and understand the role of organic acids and phosphatases in plant mixtures in accessing the organic P from the inositol phosphate pool. We shall then explore what happens to these organic P forms in the soils and the rhizosphere and examine their potential (or otherwise) for leaching from the soil to surface waters where they may cause eutrophication. A range of experiments will be carried out to identify potentially suitable strains of barley and clover for such a system, followed by experiments incorporating different combinations of these strains, grown in soil, to assess what combinations can most efficiently access different forms of organic P, while minimizing leaching losses. By increasing the amount of P utilized from the P stored in soils we can reduce the reliance on inorganic fertilisers, increasing agricultural sustainability and improving our ability to deliver food security in coming decades.  Technical Summary Organic phosphorus is a common constituent of the P in many soils and comprises mostly of esters of fully oxidised P where P is attached to C through an O atom. Other compounds such as phosphonates and organic polyphosphates occur in lesser amounts. Our appreciation of the extent to which crop plants can utilise organic P pools in soils is limited. The overarching aim of the project is to test the hypothesis that: Cropping systems with roots exuding both organic acid anions and phytase can facilitate more sustainable agricultural production by accessing soil organic P forms.   We will investigate and attempt to understand the role of organic acid anions and phosphatases in exemplar plant mixtures in accessing organic P in soils. We shall then explore what happens to these compounds in the soils and the rhizosphere. A range of experiments will be carried out to identify potentially suitable strains of barley and clover for such a system, followed by experiments incorporating different combinations of these strains, grown in soil, to assess what combinations can most efficiently access different forms of organic P, while minimizing the losses of P via leachate. Experiments and techniques employed will include screening of plant populations for abilities to exude organic acids and phosphatases using anion exchange resins (AERs) and DGT (diffusive gradients in thin films), HPLC, enzyme hydrolysis and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis, for identification of organic P compounds and groups in soil extracts and soil water.

It aims to develop completely new markets and achieve breakthroughs in performance.  CSIC focuses on the innovative use of emerging technologies in sensor and data management (e.g. fibre optics, MEMS, computer vision, power harvesting, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Wireless Sensor Networks). It aims to develop completely new markets and achieve breakthroughs in performance.  The outputs of the Centre will provide the construction industry and infrastructure owners and operators with the means to ensure that very challenging new performance targets can be met. Furthermore, the potential breakthroughs will make the industry more efficient and therefore more profitable. They will give UK companies a competitive advantage in the increasingly global construction market.  CSIC works closely with our large network of industry partners in developing the strategic direction for the Centre and in collaborative projects. To date, the Centre has over 30 demonstration projects and case studies.  In this proposal for Tranche 2 funding, we seek to build on the research and demonstration projects carried out in the Core programme and the Tranche 1 Collaborative Projects, with a strong focus on developing the outputs of these projects to be market ready, through development of the technologies into products and through standardisation of the deployment of sensor technologies in infrastructure environments and of the analysis of the data produced.  Important to this aim is the creation of an 'incubator team' who will carry out product development activities and will deploy sensor technologies in the field, further demonstrating and refining CSIC's capability and demonstrating the value of this capability to the market. The team will be constituted so that it can respond rapidly to client demand for demonstration and deployment of technologies and interpretation of data, creating maximum value for our industry partners.  This will result in a number of outputs designed to catalyse widespread uptake in the infrastructure industry, including:  1) Specific commercialisation opportunities for the technologies through joint ventures, spin outs or licensing of IP;  2) Consulting services, deploying sensors to assist clients e.g. in monitoring sensitive structures during construction, understanding live performance of assets or designing new assets efficiently based on data from monitored assets;  3) Development of best practice guidance for structural health monitoring of assets, deployment of sensor networks, and analysis of data; and  4) Development of training packages for industry  In addition to this, CSIC will carry out further research to expand the capability of the Centre's technologies into new areas, as identified by our industry partners through meetings and workshops.

Validation and evaluation processes will also be tested during the pilot. Emma aims to showcase excellence in innovative teaching methodologies and learning approaches through the large-scale piloting of MOOCs, providing a system for the delivery of free, open, online courses from diverse European universities with the goal of preserving Europe's rich cultural, educational and linguistic heritage and promoting cross-cultural and multi-lingual learning. MOOCs are a recent development, rapidly becoming a significant trend in higher education. The open nature of MOOCs provides opportunities for expanding access to higher education and creating a space for experimentation with online teaching and learning. This exploration of new approaches for higher education provision has generated significant interest from governments, institutions and others. Building on existing and proven technology, EMMA will provide an opportunity, even for smaller institutions, to share high-quality content. EMMA will provide a framework and infrastructure, while participating institutions will remain autonomous in their choice of design, methodology and tools. EMMA will operate in two main modes; as an aggregator and hosting system of courses produced by European universities; and as a system that enables learners to construct their own courses using units from MOOCs as building blocks. The EMMA Consortium aims at a multi-lingual, multi-cultural approach to learning by offering inbuilt translation and transcription services for courses hosted on the platform. The pilot will operate in 2 steps, first by making available a significant number of existing courses from project partners and/or MOOCs providers and then by bringing on board a second tier of universities keen to experiment with MOOCs. Pilots will run in 7 countries with a total of 16 MOOCs and will involve at least 60.000 users. Courses will be offered in the language of each country, in English, and the pilot will trial an embryo form of multi-lingual translation by offering courses in Italian and Spanish as well. Advances in learning analytics will feature in the analysis and evaluation work and a series of innovative approaches will be trialed to make the piloted service sustainable in the medium to long term.

The device, based on novel biosensors, will be of high-sensitivity, portable and capable of repeating measurements over a long time, allowing permanent deployment at sea. The word “MARIA” is the plural of the Latin “mar” (sea) and expresses the wide applicability that this system offers in multiple locations where low-cost and real-time in situ analytical monitoring devices are required. The approach includes: a) a sensing and analysis box, b) a modular communication system, c) a flexible power system, d) a software platform, and e) a cell phone application. The box will transmit the collected data in real time through different channels according to local needs and geographical location: radio, GSM/GPRS/3G, WiFi, WiMAX or satellite link. The unit will be designed to be remotely controlled and will implement the OTA programming and OTA configuration features which will allow the user to update the firmware of the MariaBox unit and modify various configuration parameters wirelessly. Remote updates are a key factor in deployment scalability since it offers the only possibility of easily updating or reprogramming the devices after the initial deployment. Therefore, the maintenance costs are significantly reduced. Biosensors will be developed for 5 man-made chemicals and for 4 categories of microalgae toxins relevant to shell fish and fish farming. The novel biosensors will contribute to new standards for environmental analysis. The analytes selected for the biosensors are in line with 1) the Article 16 of the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC), 2) the Decision 2455/2001/EC and 3) The Commission Directive 2009/90/EC. The system developed will be demonstrated and validated in four different scenarios in selected locations in Norway, Spain, Cyprus and Ireland.

Tool wear is the greatest single contributor to scrap (waste material). In the surgical products market, cosmetic finish requirements (16RA) placed on the precision engineered parts continue to be raised to new levels. Similarly, in the aerospace industry parts need to be increasingly accurate in order to increase energy efficiency. Through the development of CNC technology tolerances of 1µm are now possible. However, SMEs see significant failures in the current technology. Currently, errors associated with tool wear remain uncompensated for and are usually only detected at the end of the machine cycle, by which time the product is scrap. If such monitoring were available, machining parameters could be adjusted to compensate for tool wear, tools could be replaced earlier, machines could be scheduled for down-time and surface finish and dimensional stability would be increased. Such advances would have a strong impact on the efficiency of processes and increase competitive advantage. The specific aim of the project is to develop a robust ‘smart’ sensor-based system to provide process a feedback loop to both the CNC machine and the operator.

The impact of end-of-season  drought and heat stress on the rhizobial symbiosis, and its consequences for plant performance, will be studied. Two characters that can influence grain legume yield, autofertility and number of flowering nodes, will be investigated. The potential for improving legume nutritional and organoleptic quality by identification of desirable traits and innovative selection methods will be investigated. LEGATO will conceive sustainable legume-based cropping systems  adapted to different pedoclimatic zones, respecting local constraints.  The project has been constructed around the participation of commercial partners including SMEs in the areas of marker development, plant breeding, and legume food processing, who will benefit from the advances made in these areas in LEGATO. Promising legume varieties and cropping systems will be tested at a series of pan-european sites to favour the widest possible take-up in agriculture, and the partners potentially concerned will participate in a stakeholder forum convened regularly during the project.

Selected FAEs and GEs available within the consortium will be improved for their thermo- and solvent- resistance and substrate specificity by site-directed mutagenesis and directed evolution. Novel enzymes will be discovered by mining for new genes from available genomes. An inventory of novel FAEs and GEs will be developed including 50 fungal and 500 bacterial esterases, 25 site-directed and 20 directed evolved mutants. Enzymatic performances will be optimized to enhance the yield (up to the theoretical yield of 100%) and productivity (up to 0.5-1 g/l/h) of reactions giving the main targeted antioxidants: butyl ferulate, p-coumarate, caffeate, sinapate and 5-O-(trans-feruloyl)-arabinofuranose (using FAEs), glucuronate and benzyl glucuronate (using GEs). FAEs and GEs will be also tested for production of other compounds with improved biological activity and properties of hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity for cosmetic applications. Cost-effective methods will be developed for production of the new biocatalysts, in the g/L scale, and for their technical application to produce antioxidants for cosmetic industry, up to 20L. Enzyme immobilization will increase their recyclability up to ten cycles. The ability of the developed catalysts to work in conditions miming the industrial ones with reduced use of solvents and lower temperature than the chemical routes will be demonstrated. The techno-economic viability and environmental friendliness will be assessed considering a full industrial scale scenario. OPTIBIOCAT involves a highly skilled and multidisciplinary partnership of 16 partners from 8 EU countries, and it is a strongly industry driven project through the participation of 8 SMEs and 1 large company.

As the stability in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), antioxidant activity and bioavailability of particular Bacillus carotenoids was shown to be higher than those of common dietary carotenoids, the conclusions from COLORSPORE provided strong and compelling reasons to support further development and commercialisation of these bacteria-derived carotenoids. CARODEL will therefore focus on the development of an efficient oral delivery strategy of such highly active carotenoids, in combination with evaluation of potential direct health-beneficial (probiotic) activity of the Bacillus delivery vehicle, with the ultimate aim to improve biomarkers associated with (the prevention of) cardiovascular disease (CVD). The relevance of using carotenoids for CVD prevention was recently shown by a positive EFSA opinion on the use of tomato lycopene for maintenance of a healthy blood flow. In practice, effective delivery of the carotenoids to the human body will be compared upon administration as i) vegetative Bacillus cells, ii) Bacillus spores or iii) extracted carotenoids. In parallel, the ability of the Bacillus strain to exert bona fide effects (i.e., effects on the host microbiota, metabolism and immunity) will be investigated using in vitro gut models and in vivo rat studies. Based on this, the best delivery strategy will be selected and validated in a human study, in which carotenoid bioavailability will be validated as well as endpoints related to CVD biomarkers and potential probiotic activity. In combination with a full safety assessment, a proof-of-concept production strategy and development of a business plan, the scientific evidence compiled in this project will provide a framework for efficient further commercialisation of a well-documented Bacillus carotenoid product
100|grant.3499988|EP/K019368/1|Self-Resilient Reconfigurable Assembly Systems with In-process Quality Improvement|Self-Resilient Reconfigurable Assembly Systems with In-process Quality Improvement|Globalization and ever-changing customer demands resulting in product customization, variety and time to market have intensified enormous competition in automotive and aerospace, manufacturing worldwide. Manufacturers are under tremendous pressures to meet changing customer needs quickly and cost effectively without sacrificing quality. Responding to these challenges manufacturers have offered flexible and reconfigurable assembly systems. However, a major challenge is how to obtain production volume flexibility for a product family with low investment and capability to yield high product quality and throughput while allowing quick production ramp-up.  Overcoming these challenges involves three requirements which are the focus of this proposal: (1) Model reconfigurable assembly system architecture. The system architecture should purposefully take into account future uncertainties triggered by product family mix and product demands. This will require minimizing system changeability while maximizing system reusability to keep cost down; (2) Develop novel methodologies that can predict process capability and manage product quality for given system changeability requirements; and (3) Take advantage of emerging technologies & rapidly integrate them into existing production system, for e.g., new joining processes (Remote Laser Welding) and new materials. This project will address these factors by developing a self-resilient reconfigurable assembly system with in-process quality improvement that is able to self-recover from (i) 6-sigma quality faults; and (ii) changes in design and manufacturing. In doing so, it will go beyond state-of-the-art and practice in following ways: (1) Since current system architectures face significant challenges in responding to changing requirements, this initiative will incorporate cost, time and risks involving necessary changes by integrating uncertainty models; decision models for needed changes; and system change modelling; and (2) Current in-process quality monitoring systems use point-based measurements with limited 6-sigma failure root cause identification. They seldom correct operational defects quickly and do not provide in-depth information to understand and model manufacturing defects related to part and subassembly deformation. Usually, existing surface-based scanners are used for parts inspection not in-process quality control. This project will integrate in-line surface-based measurement with automatic Root Cause Analysis, feedforward/feedback process adjustment and control to enhance system response to fault or quality/productivity degradation. The research will be conducted for reconfigurable assembly system with multi-sector applications. It will involve system changeability/adaptation and in-process quality improvement for: (i) Automotive door assembly for implementing an emerging joining technology, e.g. Remote Laser Welding (RLW), for precise closed-loop surface quality control; and (ii) Airframe assembly for predicting process capability also for precise closed-loop surface quality control.  Results will yield significant benefits to the UK's high value manufacturing sector. It will further enhance the sector by accelerating introduction of new emerging eco-friendly processes, e.g., RLW. It will foster interdisciplinary collaboration across a range of disciplines such as data mining and process mining, advanced metrology, manufacturing, and complexity sciences, etc. The integration of reconfigurable assembly systems (RAS) with in-process quality improvement (IPQI) is an emerging field and this initiative will help to engender the development into an internationally important area of research. The results of the research will inform engineering curriculum components especially as these relate to training future engineers to lead the high value manufacturing sector and digital economy.

The chemical industry (specialties excluded) is not yet embracing enzymatic oxidation reactions to a significant extent primarily due to lack of biocatalysts with the required selectivity, availability and compatibility with the rigorous process conditions. Selected industrial oxidation and oxyfunctionalization target reactions form the basis for the INDOX screening and optimization of new biocatalysts, including: i) Intermediates for agrochemicals/APIs; ii) Polymer precursors and functionalized polymers; and iii) Intermediates for dye-stuffs. The project flow comprises: i) Recovery of selective biocatalysts from the groups of heme-peroxidases/peroxygenases, flavo-oxidases and copper-oxidoreductases from fungal genomes and other sources; ii) Improvement of their oxidative activity and stability by protein engineering (using rational design, directed evolution and hybrid approaches combined with computational calculations) to fulfill the operational and catalytic conditions required by the chemical industry; and iii) Optimization of reaction conditions and reactor configurations (including immobilization technologies and new enzymatic cascade reactions). Finally the cost efficiency compared to chemical processing will be evaluated. The INDOX approach is supported by a highly-specialized consortium of SMEs, large companies and research/academic institutions. Production of the new optimized biocatalysts and their introduction into the chemical market will take advantage from the participation of the world-leading company in the sector of industrial enzymes, together with several chemical companies willing to implement the new medium- and large-scale biotransformation processes.

The transfer of experience and skills will be secured through the exchange of researchers between Brazil and Europe, and a detailed program of courses, events and coaching. BETRAPOCYS will be carried out by three Brazilian and five European research organisations.  The successful development of novel, improved polymeric materials and products from academic research to industrial practice requires an integrated Chain-of-Knowledge approach. This chain is now partly broken due to different industrial and academic foci. BETRAPOCYS aims to bridge this gap by exploiting the ultimate properties of the macromolecular knowledge chain in new sophisticated applications. The knowledge transfer programme in support of this goal consists of dedicated training courses aligned with the WPs, and common knowledge-transfer events to facilitate knowledge exchange between researchers within and outside the consortium.  Bulk polyolefins are now produced using gas- and slurry phase processes with heterogeneous multi-site catalysts, allowing for good polymer particle morphology control and high bulk density without reactor fouling. However, it is more difficult to fine-tune the properties than with homogeneous single-site catalysts. The latter require immobilization to reach/exceed the same performance level; a serious challenge to be faced. BETRAPOCYS aims to study the supportation of multiple single-site catalysts onto silicate-type nano-fillers, graphene and carbon nanotubes, to produce well-processible reactor blends of tailor-made composition. The consortium will study catalyst systems, the preparation and characterisation of the bimodal blends, and the resultant properties of the systems."""

100|grant.3560232|AH/K007041/1|Haydn, Solfeggio, and the Art of Melody: A New Approach to the Classical Style|Haydn, Solfeggio, and the Art of Melody: A New Approach to the Classical Style|Solfeggi, or studies in melody, were central to the training of European musicians c.1670-1850. The method originated in Italian conservatoires for disadvantaged children, especially at Naples and Bologna. The presence of large ms. collections in European archives (almost 300 in Italy alone) testifies to the importance of this kind of exercise for composition and performance in the 18th and 19th centuries, including for the 'Classical Style' of Haydn and Mozart, which continues to underpin modern notions of art-music as an academic discipline and creative industry. Despite its historical significance and its potential to enliven current debates, the tradition has featured fleetingly, if at all, in modern scholarship. The reasons for this are complex, but can be explained in part by a prevailing Germanocentric bias and a continuing reliance on 19th-century theories. In mapping out a significant new direction for musicology, this project challenges ingrained attitudes founded on a dominant national(ist) meta-narrative, framed in 19th-century Germany. It demonstrates the importance of music as a mechanism of transnational cultural exchange, which in many ways transcends linguistic barriers. It explores a vanished network of cultural relations - a shared understanding of melody - that once brought together the poorest and richest on (almost) equal terms. Although the conservatoires that pioneered solfeggi produced musicians for the super-rich, to provide entertainment at courts and chapels, they were at the same time charitable institutions that offered vocational training for the poor and dispossessed. Many great musicians of the western tradition (including Haydn) rose to exalted status from humble backgrounds, primarily through the spread of these training methods. This Fellowship will produce the first monograph on the solfeggio tradition, supported by a free online database, public engagement and networking activities. It will reconstruct a forgotten art of melody, drawing on primary source material not available elsewhere, to provide scholars with a framework for further studies and performers, teachers, and learners with new insights (by e.g. informing the development of curricula and music education software, facilitating collaboration through an international network, offering workshops at schools and conservatoires, preparing an international conference and exhibition, attracting PhD students, and mentoring a research assistant). To focus its scope, the study investigates Haydn's operas and string quartets in light of the teachings of Neapolitan maestro Nicola Porpora, from whom he claimed to have learned 'the true fundamentals of composition'. This involves the construction of a new theory, which inverts the conventional modern understanding of western 'common practice' music by identifying the main compositional determinant not in the bass, as bearer of harmony, but in the melody, as bearer of form (or discourse). Solfeggi taught melodic writing and 'conduct', or what would now be called musical form. The solfeggio tradition embodies the meritocratic spirit of the Enlightenment. It testifies to a shared European heritage of melody as a cultural practice (or a kind of language) that crossed national boundaries. Meaningful parallels can be drawn with contemporary popular music culture, which can similarly unite people across linguistic and social barriers. Haydn learned his craft busking on the streets and backing singers. His music was founded on the elaboration of simple well-known formulas, like modern pop music. Its aim was to entertain. With appropriate leadership, this seminal study of the solfeggio tradition will contribute to an increased understanding of inter-cultural relations in terms of the influence of a transnational diaspora (primarily of Italian musicians, transmitting their practices across Europe through oral teachings) and the power of music as a common language of popular culture.

An understanding of the biological mechanisms regulating food consumption is essential to both the successful treatment and prevention of obesity and type 2 diabetes. The brain represents the master co-coordinator of energy balance, employing a number of interwoven neurological circuits to continually appraise and respond to changes in nutritional state. The brain melanocortin network is a fundamental regulator of energy homeostasis and serves as a gateway for many of these signals. Therefore, a clear understanding of the precise mechanism through which pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) modulates appetite, food preference, body weight, and blood glucose is of intense interest. The aim of this application is to identify specific POMC neurons responsible for communicating energy balance information and to demonstrate that their manipulation, through state of the art pharmacogenetic and genetic techniques, is of direct relevance to metabolic fitness. We will also examine the impact of diet and adiposity on POMC energy balance circuitry function. Through the identification of primary, critical cells in the brain regulating energy balance, we anticipate that these data will ultimately have translational benefit for the treatment of global metabolic disease.  Technical Summary The rapid rise in the prevalence of obesity emphasizes the need for a greater understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying energy homeostasis. Whilst traditional Cre-lox technology has demonstrated pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons to be a critical nexus for the integration of multiple energy balance circuits and fundamental to the physiological control of metabolic health, this approach does not permit functional and temporal dissociation of discrete populations of POMC neurons. Thus, the aim of this project is to establish the distinct role of NTS POMC neurons in the regulation of energy and glucose homeostasis. On the basis of our preliminary data, we hypothesise this population to be a critical component of the central metabolic network. Targeted manipulation of NTS POMC neurons will be facilitated by the use of cutting-edge pharmacogenetic technology (Designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug - DREADD). This technique affords real-time control of neuronal activity and subsequent insight into their physiological function. Sterotaxic delivery of viral constructs into the NTS of a POMC-Cre mouse line promotes selective expression of DREADD receptors on NTS POMC neurons. Targeted activation/inhibition of these cells in freely behaving mice is induced by the administration of an inert ligand. The cell specific pharmacogenetic manipulation, together with comprehensive metabolic phenotyping (including food intake, diet preference, energy expenditure and glucose homeostasis), affords the opportunity for greater understanding of the physiological salience of brainstem POMC neurons. These data will offer important insight into the discrete neuronal circuits governing energy and glucose homeostasis. Given the pervasiveness of metabolic disease within the global community and the resulting socio-medical ramifications, unravelling the neuronal microcircuits governing the physiological control of energy balance is essential.

Should this continue, the capacity to innovate both in industry and research will suffer in the long term.  A critical issue in addressing this problem is providing young people with relevant contexts and practical experience of scientific concepts through classroom science.  Therefore, the development of Inquiry Based Science Education (IBSE) and active teaching and learning approaches has never been more important.  The Chain Reaction project aims to capitalise on a previously successful approach to delivering IBSE in the UK in an attempt to embed IBSE practice within European schools. The key aim is to equip teacher educators to train teachers across twelve countries in the use of IBSE materials and techniques.  Each country will adapt materials and techniques for use in their own country, addressing issues of different curricula and cultures as necessary. This will ensure that each partner will have ownership of resources and classroom techniques suitable for their own situation and contexts, but based around the proven principles of IBSE and based on materials that have already been tried and tested as part of the original Pupil Researcher Initiative (PRI) project. Chain Reaction will also establish a European teachers' network, aimed at providing support to teachers, sharing experiences and expertise between teachers and training experts. This will help develop the work of the project through delivery, and will also contribute to sustainability in the longer term. The network will aid dissemination of the project resources and outcomes, while enabling peer support both within each year of the project, and across the project as a whole.   This will ensure sharing, reflection and discussions of experiences and approaches. The teacher training, materials and instruction given will be delivered via a cascade approach within schools.

Our aim is to understand exactly how the virus initiates infection of its target cell and how it interfers with the workings of the host cell to cause disease. HCV is a major cause of serious liver disease. It is estimated that approximately 200 million people globally are infected with this virus, a significant number of whom will go on to develop serious liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Current worldwide projections estimate that HCV in particular will be a major source of morbidity and mortality before the end of this decade. Although new promising treatments are now becoming available, there are many unmet needs and there is as yet no vaccine available. Therefore, basic research on viral proteins to enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of virus infection is needed to develop better anti-viral therapies. Our investigations of the functions and structures of the relevant virus and host proteins will allow better understanding of the processes involved in virus life cycle and disease. The information gained will be crucial in developing novel antiviral drugs and vaccines.  Technical Summary Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease that often leads to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Promising new treatments are now becoming available, but they are focused on one viral genotype. There are many unmet needs and therefore HCV will remain a serious threat for the foreseeable future. There is as yet no vaccine available. To develop new targets for a broad and more effective therapy, and preventative vaccines, it is necessary to gain greater insights into the processes involved in virus life cycle and their effects on cellular metabolism.  Our research is focused on investigating the mechanisms of HCV entry into target cells and the interactions between viral and cellular components involved in virus life cycle and pathogenesis. Specifically, we have been studying virus neutralizing antibodies and their mode of action both at structural and functional level, modes of virus transmission in cultured cells, and the functional significance of the interaction between the HCV core protein and host factors. Closely aligned to the above work, we have (1) developed several robust cell-based high-throughput screening assays that have enabled us to identify novel anti-viral compounds targeting different stages of the virus life-cycle and (2) an on-going translational project on the development of antibody-based vaccine against HCV. My group is a member of the Glasgow HCV Network (a consortium of clinicians and scientists) and a national consortium called HCV Research UK focused on fundamental research, clinical studies and translational approaches on HCV. Our aim is to investigate molecular mechanisms that contribute to HCV-associated pathogenesis. The work performed under this programme includes whole genome transcriptome analysis in diseased liver, and investigating host factors that determine viral clearance or progression to chronicity and extrahepatic disorders. In addition, we are studying the interaction between HCV core and the cellular DEAD-box protein, DDX3. Our data show that this interaction is dispensable for virus life cycle, but may be involved in apoptosis, oncogenesis and aspects of innate immunity. We also find that DDX3 interacts with a variety of cellular factors involved in host RNA metabolism thus implicating the core-DDX3 interaction in these processes, which may in turn contribute to viral pathogenesis. We are investigating the mechanisms for the sequestration of the host factors and their functions in infected cells. Identification of functional pathways is likely to provide novel targets for pharmacological intervention and treatment of HCV-related diseases.

Indeed, the research activity focuses on how the ""busy genius"" and the ""SHERPA animals"" interact and collaborate with each other, with their own features and capabilities, toward the achievement of a common goal.A mix of advanced control and cognitive capabilities characterize the SHERPA system, aiming to support the rescuer by improving his awareness of the rescue scene even in tough environments and with the ""genius"" often ""busy"" in the rescuing activity (and thus unable to supervise the platform). Thus emphasis is placed on robust autonomy of the platform, acquisition of cognitive capabilities, collaboration strategies, natural and implicit interaction between the ""genius"" and the ""SHERPA animals"", which motivate the research activity.Five benchmarks, inspired by real-world scenarios, drive the research and motivate demonstration activities on realistic testing sites planned during the project.Seven top academic groups, two SMEs, and the Italian Association of Alpine Rescuers with the role of end-user and evaluator of the project outcomes for the specific application of search and rescuing in the alpine scenario compose the consortium."

At the same time public funding enabled the community to become more organised on both the research (EURON) and the industrial (EUROP) side and to develop the currently valid Strategic Research Agenda (SRA).Very recently EURON and EUROP decided to combine their portfolio of activities and member base within a new non-profit organisation, euRobotics AISBL, which intends to engage in a contractual Public-Private Partnership (PPP) with the European Commission (EC). The main players behind this success story have joined in this project to address the most important challenges for the coming three to five years:- Professional coordination of technology roadmapping and implementation of innovation activities- Fostering collaboration among all stakeholders of European robotics- Promoting European roboticsThis project's ambition is to create sustainable solutions for these challenges, building on the successful instruments the robotics community has already experimented with. These instruments have not yet fully achieved the required goals, partly because of a lack of dedicated, professional support and partly because the challenges have changed as a consequence of the higher ambitions and the larger set of stakeholders to be involved. This will change with the recent founding of euRobotics AISBL and the commitment of both industrial and academic stakeholders to more closely and formally cooperate, but especially through the PPP with the EC. The following activities are planned engaging the whole community:- Robotics roadmap coordination- Robotics PPP preparation and ramp-up- Facilitating robotics innovation- Robotics networking- Dissemination and outreachThese core activities will defragment the community and construct a European robotics industry with sufficient identity and presence to create world leadership in terms of both strategic capability and economic impact.
100|grant.2772151|MC_UP_1002/1|Mitochondrial Medicine|Mitochondrial Medicine|This programme will allow us to identify new disease-genes and proteins, to investigate disease mechanisms, and to test new interventions for effective treatment of Mitochondrial Disorders, a group of genetic maladies characterized by dysfunction of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), the energy-supplying metabolic pathway carried out by the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) complexes. Thirteen MRC protein subunits are encoded by mtDNA, which adds to the genetic, functional and structural complexity of OXPHOS, and of its disorders as well. The heterogeneity of mitochondrial disorders makes the identification of effective therapy an exceedingly difficult task. However, the elucidation of many of the pathophysiological features of these conditions give us now several clues for the development of therapeutic strategies, with the ultimate goal to cure mitochondrial disease.  Technical Summary This project is aimed at identifying new genes responsible for mitochondrial disorders, characterized by isolated or combined defects of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) complexes by exome sequencing of human DNA samples using Illumina technology. An inter-institutional agreement between the MRC-MBU in Cambridge, UK and the Fondazione Istituto Neurologico Carlo Besta, Milan, Italy, allow us to get access to genomic DNA samples from numerous patients with biochemically defined mitochondrial diseases. To the same aim, collaborations have been established with other Research Centres in the UK, such as the Mitochondrial Disease Centre at the University of Newcastle and the Institute of Neurology at Queen Square in London; and abroad, e.g. the Max Planck Institute for Aging in Cologne, and the Institute of Human Genetics in Munich, Germany. We expect that the project will lead to the genetic definition of all or most of our cohort of probands, an achievement that will contribute to define the molecular-genetic basis of this vast group of conditions. The identification of new mitochondrial disease proteins is essential to further elucidate the pathogenesis of mitochondrial disorders, is important to complete our knowledge on the composition of the human mitochondrial proteome, and will contribute to the molecular characterization of mitochondrial energy-related pathways. This goal will be implemented by creating recombinant cell models for new mutant genes, in vitro characterization by proteomics approaches, and investigating suitable animal models, including mouse and zebrafish. Examples of gene products that will be studied include TTC19, an assembly factor for complex III; Mpv17, a mitochondrial protein of unknown function whose mutations cause profound depletion of mtDNA in livers of knockout mice and patients; FBXL4 and Apopt1, two proteins of unknown function associated with mtFDNA depletion and deficiency of cytochrome c oxidase, respectively; and Pitrm1, a mitochondrial protease we recently found mutated in patients showing a neurodegenerative disease. The molecular and functional characterization of new disease genes/proteins and pathways will underpin the development of rational therapeutic strategies. Effective therapy for OXPHOS diseases is missing. We have collected a huge series of mutant cell (fibroblast) lines and created numerous mouse recombinant lines with specific defects in genes associated with human mitochondrial disease. The availability of these tools will be exploited to develop experimental therapy transferable to humans. The translational agenda that will be implemented at the MBU will include three main strategies for experimental therapy, based on (a) Activators of mitochondrial biogenesis acting on the PGC1-alpha axis; (b) Gene replacement using adeno-associated viral vectors; (c) Xenogene targeting using alternative oxidases expressed in recombinant mouse lines.

This imbalance leads to the perturbation of important cellular mechanisms (such accumulation of oxidants and of cells belonging to the immune system), which will contribute to lung environmental changes. It is believed that these changes may favor the deleterious chronic bacterial colonization in the lung of CF-affected individuals. We have discovered that an important protective cellular response (heme-oxygenase-1/carbon monoxide) that normally is increased in non-CF lungs exposed to bacteria, virus and other stressor, is inefficiently induced in the lungs of CF patients as a consequence of defective CFTR function. In this proposal we aim to investigate the correlation between this dysfunction and CF lung disease, and whether restoration of this protective response may ameliorate CF lung disease. We will also test whether drugs that are already in use for other diseases (therefore safe to use on patients) and that are known to stimulate this protective response, can ameliorate CF dysfunctions on pre-clinical models for CF. At the end of this study, we will understand whether modulation of this protective response can be considered a potential therapeutic intervention for CF patients.

An estimated 15 million individuals are living with HCV infection within the EU. The economic, health and societal costs of chronic HCV infection are significant. HCV is the principal cause of death from liver disease and the leading indication for liver transplantation. The only treatment for end-stage liver disease is a liver transplant, yet the transplanted liver becomes rapidly re-infected and is frequently destroyed within 5 years after transplantation.  In this cohort of patients current antiviral treatments are too toxic - there is an urgent need to develop safe and effective treatments for use in this setting. Human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that target virus entry, are as yet an underutilised and potentially highly effective and safe weapon in the armoury against HCV infection. The consortium has identified MAb leads which, in pre-clinical analyses, potently block HCV infection.  HCV exhibits a high degree of genetic and antigenic variability, which enables the virus to escape protective immune responses. Crucially, the lead antibodies identified by the consortium are capable of preventing infection by a wide range of genetically distinct isolates because they target highly conserved epitopes on the virus or host receptor molecules. This limits the chances of virus resistance. Also, each lead antibody targets a unique component of the viral entry pathway, thereby paving the way for powerful combinatorial approaches which maximises clinical potency. HepaMAb harnesses leading expertise in MAb technology, preclinical efficacy and safety testing, biomanufacture and clinical trial to progress at least one anti-viral and one anti-receptor human MAb to phase I/IIa proof of concept clinical trial in the liver transplant setting for the prevention of graft reinfection. We will establish a much-needed therapeutic MAb pipeline for use in this solid organ transplant setting.

It brings together a consortium with diverse experience with gender equality mainstreaming approaches, with varying institutional and disciplinary backgrounds and located in different national contexts. All, however, share common challenges for women engaged in research and all have identified three common areas for intervention: (i) recruitment, progression and research support; (ii) working environment, work-life balance and institutional culture, and finally, (iii) the increasingly important domain of standards and diversity in research excellence and innovation. Each partner university will address these areas through their individually tailored GEAPs that will build on existing structures and policies where relevant, or develop new systems and practices where appropriate. This contextualised approach will be supported by an ongoing knowledge-exchange system within the consortium and by ongoing participatory evaluation, both of which will maximise the shared learning of all partners at every step of the process. An ePortfolio system will allow individual experiences, challenges and thoughts to be documented and collated throughout the implementation process and this will inform the main deliverables of the projects: a social model of gender equality implementation and guidelines tailored to different actors and different contexts highlighting the issues, the challenges and the approaches that work. Dissemination of the outcomes will be shaped by a communications strategy for learning within the institutions, within national learning circles with key stakeholders and, internationally, through networking, media and publication activities. The long-term impact of the project will also be felt within the partner universities: the implementation of the GEAPs involves sustainability strategies for each institution to ensure that ther

The effect of this anomalous expansion of the financial system has been an increase in the perceived systemic risk and more instability. Because of this, finance seems to have become suddenly dangerous and detrimental for growth. And despite the large body of past evidences, many have started to argue that financial development is no longer a positive factor for capital accumulation. Though it is hard to conceive a radical change in the established theory which has highlighted the benefits  for the economy accruing from a developed financial system, these events have put forward the need to redefine the role of finance and financial innovation in allocating real resources. By pivoting on four main issues, the objective of the research is indeed to provide an answer to crucial questions that have emerged from recent event:  1.	Inequality: The increase in inequality in many countries is thought to have been caused by an abnormal increase in the financial sector. Does finance exacerbate income inequality? To what extent? Or rather easy access to credit reduces poverty, as it has been argued by orthodox theory? 2.	Inefficiency: By favoring some industries and sectors more than others, does an excess of growth in the financial system cause misallocation of resources? Does financial growth cause an excess in public spending? 3.	Instability: Does the abnormal growth of the financial sector cause instability? Is this instability amplified in a monetary union? Can more stringent regulation and stronger coordination reduce the impact of financial cycle on the economy? 4.	Growth and Development: Is finance and financial development really good for growth? To what extent financial development can spur growth and capital accumulation?

They act as life jackets or chaperones for proteins that, become unstable and are degraded upon mutation, although they retain the essential residues needed for activity. The same mutant proteins are able to comply their duty if they are given the chance to survive long enough and to get to the site where they are needed. The approach is getting known as pharmacological chaperone (PC) therapy and despite its novelty, it has produced a few drugs which are already in clinical trials. Fabry disease is a disorders which can benefit from PC therapy. A large variability of genotypes and phenotypes is observed and only a fraction of missense mutations respond to PC therapy. The effects of missense mutations and hence their responsiveness to drugs, depends on the site where they occur in the protein. We can learn from Fabry disease which are the molecular requisites and the limits to employ PC therapy. Moreover we can develop for this pathology novel drugs with higher potency and selectivity. Serendipity led to the discovery of PCs for the treatment of a few genetic diseases, most notably lysosomal storage diseases. Yet this approach can be successfully employed in a variety of cases. A large scale analysis of mutations responsible of monogenetic diseases was carried out producing many potential targets for PCs. We decided to start with congenital disorder of glycosylation, type Ia, a syndrome with no cure at present. We have already demonstrated that a mutation frequently encountered in this pathology can be rescued by using small chemical chaperones.

The project aims to reach a higher efficiency (10-20% SPF improvement) and lower Carbon footprint (20% lower TEWI) than the current state of the art HFCs/HFOs or Sorption heat pumps. The costs shall be very similar or slightly higher than the latter systems (10%). The project will also focus on the development of an efficient capacity modulation in order to enhance the integration capability with other renewable sources in the energy systems of Buildings and Industry. In this sense, if the project is successful, it will clearly bring a definitive step forward to overcome the barriers holding back the spread of natural refrigerants by proving that a new generation of heat pumps based on HCs and CO2 is perfectly feasible and commercially competitive.  The first objective of the project is the identification of the cases in which the use of Natural refrigerants can lead to cost effective and high efficient solutions with a fast commercial exploitation. The following cases have already been identified for their potential interest: -	Hydrocarbons (HCs): air or water to water heat pumps supplying hot water at (40-50ºC) for heating applications as well as to produce sanitary hot water at 60ºC. -	CO2: heat pump of high capacity to produce sanitary hot water at 60ºC directly from city water (10-15ºC). Designs with higher temperatures in the range 70-90ºC should be also explored.  The project involves 6 key industrial partners (component manufacturers and heat pump manufacturers) who will strongly cooperate with the RTD partners in order to achieve the targeted goals as well as to evaluate the necessary costs and measures to successfully bring the developed technology to the market.

As in the case of finite-dimensional dynamical systems, one of the main problems in this field is linked to the well-known """"small divisors problem''.

100|grant.2751763|ES/K002309/1|Systemic Risk Centre|Systemic Risk Centre|"Systemic financial risk and the impact of financial risk spilling over to the real economy, is one of the greatest threats facing the UK economy. The Centre research on systemic risk (SR) will be guided by academic principles and rigour, drawn from decision sciences, sociology, evolutionary biology, political economy and computer science, in addition to our core areas of finance, statistics and economics. We would be tempted to label it the ""Systemic Risk 2.0 Centre."" We propose to focus on 4 interrelated themes. 1. Endogenous risk, financial policy and risk forecasting 2. Computer-Based Trading (CBT), High-Frequency Trading (HFT) and endogenous market crashes 3. The impact of rules and decision-making 4. Network risk While it is clear to any observer that the financial system is made up of individuals who in aggregate determine outcomes, surprisingly most models used assume the opposite, that risk is largely exogenous with extreme outcomes supposedly dropped onto financial markets by an outside force. The reason for this is that it is hard to model risk when it is endogenous, so most find the paradigm of exogenous, albeit large, risk to provide an acceptable balance between ease and reliability. But SR by definition involves the entire system with its myriad actors linked together through subtle and endogenous networks and reacting to endogenous news, prices, rules, laws and political processes. By applying endogenous risk and network analysis we can directly identify channels for the creation of SR via the various feedback loops inherent in the financial system.  Experience suggests that endogenous and SR is ever present throughout the financial system and emerges at the confluence of different fields. The Centre research will therefore be interdisciplinary by design. A narrow research focus, based on a single discipline, is unlikely to provide much headway in the understanding of SR. Furthermore, the analysis of the behaviour of an entire system has a long history in the natural sciences. The Centre is able to draw on some of the leading experts in this field looking for a partner to applying their insights to finance. A similar natural fit can be found with computer science. Crashes through sudden coordinated selling have been endemic throughout history, but their danger is becoming more immediate with the presence of CBT as more trading is done by unthinking algorithms that follow mechanical rules at speeds making supervision physically impossible while little about the structure of markets itself is commonly known, leading to second guessing of second guesses. Such uncertainty is further deepened by the nature of the balance-sheet and trading networks which are only starting to be analysed.  One of the highest concerns to society is the design of informed rules (e.g. laws, accountancy standards etc.) and regulations that prevent the build-up of such SR and allow feedback loops to be cut once they operate. Unfortunately, regulating markets is fraught with difficulties, not least because of the law of unintended consequences that pervades finance. It is tempting to argue that if any one actor acts safely, then the system altogether is safe. To go beyond this partial equilibrium based fallacy of composition forms a major impetus of our work and leads to robust regulations. Furthermore, such rules are themselves endogenous. It is impossible to understand SR without attention to the political aspects of decision-making that can either lead the authorities to be captured by special interests, stall excessively on decision-making or provide robust resolution of a crisis. In that sense, SR is significantly politically constructed as society has created complex that were all the outcomes of political struggles and compromises. Through our close relationships, the output of the Centre directly impacts policy making and supervision, and the Centre in return is itself informed by policy makers' needs and interests."

Special attention will be paid to clearly demonstrate the capabilities and benefits of this technology with benchmark circuits and advanced system applications in the 0.1 to 1 THz range like THz imaging and sensing, wireless Gb/s communications and millimeter-wave radar.For a given lithography node, HBTs provide much higher cut-off frequencies compared to CMOS transistors while offering higher power density and better analog performance. SiGe HBT technology and SiGe HBT enhanced CMOS (SiGe BiCMOS) are key enablers for demanding mm-wave systems requiring more than a few µWatts of RF output power (which limits the applicability of even very advanced CMOS) and also offer high integration levels at low cost which precludes expensive and less integrated III-V solutions.10 out of the 12 DOTSEVEN participants were already partnering in the predecessor FP7 project DOTFIVE which succeeded for the first time to push fmax of SiGe HBTs (at room temperature) into the 500 GHz region thus setting a new world-wide benchmark. Triggered by the impressive DOTFIVE results, several activities in the rest of the world already have started to catch up or even surpass our achievements.The main objective of the highly qualified and motivated DOTSEVEN consortium is therefore to significantly expand the successful work of DOTFIVE, to further strengthen Europe's leading edge position in SiGe HBT technology and modeling as well as SiGe enabled mm-wave applications and to stay significantly ahead of non-European competition. A powerful and success-proven consortium has been set-up to achieve these goals. It consists of 5 industrial partners (including 3 SMEs) and 9 well distinguished academic research institutes spread all over Europe.

They play vital roles in global ecology and biotechnology. Like plants microalgae are photosynthetic, fixing atmospheric carbon from carbon dioxide into carbohydrates. Microalgae thus participate in the global carbon cycle and play a critical role in climate regulation. The photosynthetic ability of microalgae, together with the capacity of some species to produce oily compounds, also means they can be used as an alternative to plants as a feedstock for biofuels, which are urgently required to reduce carbon emissions and limit climate change.   In spite of recent advances, much about the growth of algal populations remains to be discovered, which limits our ability to control their growth. Indeed, microalgal populations in the environment can grow explosively into blooms, which colour their environment: from the vivid greens of ponds to the spectacular blue-greens or reds of plankton blooms in the ocean (some so extensive that they are visible from space!). Many of these blooms are benign, providing a bounty for organisms that feed on microalgae (from fish larvae to whales). However, some microalgal species form `harmful algal blooms' (HAB), noxious because of the toxins they produce, or because their growth starves or suffocates other species. Each year HABs kill significant numbers of fish, but also marine animals and people, with substantial economic impact. A better understanding of algal growth could help predict and prevent HABs. It could also help the production of microalgal biofuels. Oily plants are currently used for biofuel production, e.g. rapeseed is a common feedstock to make biodiesel. Competition with food crops, however, makes plants problematic biofuel candidates. Microalgae, on the other hand, grow almost anywhere, faster than plants, using only sunlight and recycled industrial/agricultural waste nutrients, gases and water. However, no biofuel is currently manufactured industrially from microalgae due to high production costs.   Many microalgal species have evolved the ability to swim and bias their swimming to better navigate in water and source food. Symbiosis with bacteria also provides nutritional benefits, such as essential vitamins. Recent advances in physics of biased swimming microalgae and the biology of symbiotic nutrition have not yet applied to the study of growth of swimming microalgal populations. We propose to carry out the first systematic study of the growing populations of swimming microalgae to consider both the physics of swimming and the role of symbiotic bacteria. In particular, using a combination of mathematical modelling and experiments we aim to quantify the growth of biased swimming microalgal populations. The results of our investigation will allow a more complete understanding of algal growth, which will in turn provide possible solutions to control HABs and to improve the economics of microalgal biofuel production.

The application of emerging technologies to advanced health monitoring of existing critical infrastructure assets can help to better quantify and define the extent of ageing and the consequent remaining design life of infrastructure, thereby reducing the risk of failure. Emerging technologies also have the potential to transform the industry through a whole-life approach to achieving sustainability in construction and infrastructure in an integrated way - design and commissioning, the construction process, exploitation and use, and eventual de-commissioning. Crucial elements of these emerging technologies include the application of the latest sensor technologies, data management tools and manufacturing processes to the construction industry, both during infrastructure construction and throughout its life. There is a substantial market for exploitation of these technologies by the construction industry, particularly contractors, specialist instrumentation companies and owners of infrastructure. In this proposal, we seek to build on the creation of the Innovation and Knowledge Centre for Smart Infrastructure and Construction which brings together leading research groups in the University of Cambridge Departments of Engineering and Architecture, Computer Laboratory and Judge Business School. The Collaborative Programme will see these groups working with industrialists and other critical stakeholders on challenging research projects which deliver practical solutions to the problems that industry faces and which promote the dissemination and adoption of valuable emerging technologies. The development and commercialisation of emerging technologies can provide radical changes in the construction and management of infrastructure, leading to considerably enhanced efficiencies, economies and adaptability. The objective is to create 'Smart Infrastructure' with the following attributes: (a) minimal disturbance and maximum efficiency during construction, (b) minimal maintenance for new infrastructure and optimum management of existing infrastructure, (c) minimal failures even during extreme events (fire, natural hazards, climate change), and (d) minimal waste materials at the end of the life cycle. The Centre focuses on the innovative use of emerging technologies in sensor and data management (e.g. fibre optics, MEMS, computer vision, power harvesting, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and Wireless Sensor Networks). These are coupled with emerging best practice in the form of the latest manufacturing and supply chain management approaches applied to construction and infrastructure (e.g. smart building components for life-cycle adaptive design, innovative manufacturing processes, integrated supply chain management, and smart management processes from building to city scales). It aims to develop completely new markets and to achieve breakthroughs in performance. Considerable business opportunities will be created for construction companies, and for other industries such as IT, electronics and materials. The Centre is able to respond directly and systematically to the input received from industry partners on what is required to address critical issues. Through the close involvement of industry in technical development as well as in demonstrations in real construction projects, the commercialisation activities of emerging technologies can be progressed to a point where they can be licensed to industry. The outputs of the Centre can provide the construction industry, infrastructure owners and operators with the means to ensure that very challenging new performance targets can be met. Furthermore breakthroughs will make the industry more efficient and hence more profitable. They can also give UK companies a competitive advantage in the increasingly global construction market.

The diffusion of the Western diet, rich in energy-dense foods, is one possible cause of weight gain. Grilling, roasting, and frying of foods leads to the formation of Maillard reaction products including non-digestible melanoidins that are primarily found in coffee and bread crust. Melanoidins are structurally similar to vegetable dietary fiber, both are non-digestible dietary components partially fermented in the gut. It is known that dietary fiber is able to trigger short-term satiety through the modulation of gut hormones controlling food intake. The objective of this project is to verify the satiating efficiency of melanoidins. New types of bread enriched with melanoidins from the crust or from coffee will be developed and their effects on short-term satiety will be compared to those elicited by barley beta-glucans-enriched bread and control bread (only crumb, no melanoidins and no dietary fiber). For this purpose a human intervention trial will be performed. In four breakfast sessions, 15 volunteers will consume in a random manner all experimental breads one by one, fill out satiety questionnaires, be submitted to blood drawings at 5 specific time points, and consume an ad libitum lunch 3 h after breakfast. In the rest of the day, they will complete a food diary to assess their 24 h energy intakes. Gut and stress hormones, as well as endocannabinoid concentrations, will be measured in blood samples by Luminex technology and mass spectrometry. Additionally, satiety gene expression in blood samples from 5 subjects at two time points will be measured by a newly developed DNA array. The CHECKMATE-TO-HUNGER project will take advantage of a multidisciplinary approach to clarify mechanisms underlying satiety induced by Maillard reaction products.

BEs stimulate root growth, solubilise and mineralise sparingly available nutrients, or protect plants from abiotic and biotic stresses. Novel BEs will be isolated, characterized and applied in strategic combination with alternative fertilisation strategies that include organic and low-input farming, use of waste recycling fertilizers, and fertiliser-placement technologies. Bio-effectors addressed comprise fungal strains of Trichoderma, Penicillium and Sebacinales, as well as bacterial strains of Bacillus and Pseudomonades with well-characterized root growth promoting and nutrient solubilising potential. Natural extraction products of seaweed, compost and plant extracts, as well as their purified active compounds are also tested in various combinations. Maize, wheat and tomato are chosen as representative crops. Laboratory and European-wide field experiments assure product adaptation to divers geo-climatic conditions. Viable alternatives to the conventional practice of mineral fertilisation are developed, towards environmental friendly agricultural practice with reduced agrochemical input.
100|grant.2782916|ST/J001961/1|Proposal for continuation of UK participation in the International Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment|Proposal for continuation of UK participation in the International Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment|Neutrinos are three different but related particles; their ability to turn into each other has given physicists their first glimpse of the physics which they know must lay beyond the Standard Model. Investigation of the physics which underlies their properties will: deepen our understanding of how the Universe developed after the Big Bang; how the current asymmetry between matter and anti-matter developed from a situation where they were created in equal amounts in the Big Bang; and help us to understand what happens when a supernova explodes showering the cosmos with the heavy elements necessary for planets and life itself to form.  In order to understand their properties, we must build an accelerator capable of creating neutrinos in immense numbers. They must have energy between well-defined limits and the mixture of different types must be very precisely known. Such a facility, known as the Neutrino Factory, would be revolutionary and to build one is a challenging project, both from the point of view of the particle detectors which must be built, and the engineering problems which must be overcome. This programme needs a world-wide collaboration, but it is one in which physicists and engineers from the UK are playing a leading role.  Neutrinos are created from a beam of muons and the muons themselves are produced from the decay of pions produced by the collision of protons with a metal target. A machine to make an intense beam of neutrinos needs to take the beam of muons, which is large and diverges rapidly, and reduce its size and divergence. The resulting beam can be accelerated, stored and when it decays produces an intense beam of neutrinos. The muons only live for 2.2 microseconds when at rest, and even when they are accelerated and their lifetime is extended by the effect of relativity, there is little time to manipulate the muons so that they are in a state to be accelerated.  MICE is an international collaboration based at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire, which uses a beam of muons created by the ISIS accelerator and aims to show that it is feasible to create such an intense beam. It will do this by creating a beam of muons of much lower intensity and tracking each one individually through one part of the system which has been designed to perform this beam compression at the Neutrino Factory. This process where the random sideways motions of the muons are reduced and we are left with the longitudinal motion is referred to as cooling the beam; the system which performs the cooling is known as the cooling channel.  The first stage was to build a system capable of producing a muon beam whose size and divergence could be adjusted before it enters the cooling channel. This was completed last year and measurements have been made to show that the beam has the flexibility and intensity for MICE to perform the required measurements. The second stage is to finish construction of the cooling channel itself and to provide a system to measure very accurately the position and momentum of each muon before and after it has passed through the cooling channel. By looking at many muons produced in many different conditions, it will be possible to determine how much cooling has been produced by the channel. In the channel itself the muons will be slowed by passing through a suitable material, such as liquid hydrogen, liquid helium or lithium hydride. As they slow they lose momentum both longitudinally and transversely to the beam axis. Then they are accelerated with high field radio frequency cavities, replacing only the longitudinal momentum.  This experiment which is pushing the boundaries of what is possible with materials, magnets and cooling technologies, represents a collaboration between particle physicists, and accelerator physicists and will demonstrate the UK's ability to host an experiment at the forefront of science and engineering.

Industrial exploitation of this natural resource using traditional approaches is, however, hampered, with a few exceptions, by unsolvable supply problems - despite of numerous efforts in the past. Therefore, there is, very likely, only one way: to start from the genes encoding the bioproducts, or their biosynthetic pathways, to sustainably obtain the active molecules in sufficient amounts. The aim of the presented industry-driven integrating project is to combine the knowledge in marine genomics, chemogenetics and advanced chemistry to produce recombinantly prepared novel secondary metabolite (lead) compounds and analogous from them, as well as pharmacologically active peptides, and to bring them up to the pre-clinical, and hopefully also to the clinical studies. This ambitious approach is based on breakthrough discoveries and the results of previous successful EU projects of members of the applying consortium, including European leaders (or worldwide leaders) in marine (sponge) genomics, metagenomics (polyketide synthase clusters), combinatorial biosynthesis and marine natural product chemistry/structure elucidation. This multidisciplinary project, driven by high-tech genomics-based SMEs with dedicated interest in bringing marine-biotechnology-derived products to the market, will also involve the discovery and sustainable production of bioactive molecules from hitherto unexploited extreme environments, such as hydrothermal vents and deep-sea sources, and the expression/scale-up of unique enzymes/proteins of biomedical and biotechnological interest. The molecular-biology-based strategies developed in this project for a sustainable exploitation of aquatic molecular biodiversity will further strengthen the international position and effectiveness of European (SME-based) blue biotechnology industry.

One of the main objectives is enlarging the patrimony of microbes for waste valorisation by i) screening the assortment of thousand microbes belonging to the collections of Brazilian and Indian partners to select the microbes most efficient in producing enzymes, EtOH, LA, PHAs ii) discovering novel strains with high potential of production of these products exploring the biodiversity of micro flora from India and Brazil and iii) exchanging technologies and tools developed by different EU and ICPC partners for genetic engineering of different microbes. Optimization of processes for production of different products and assessment of their economic and environmental feasibility will be performed with the above microbes taking advantage from the complementary consolidated expertises of the partners. Partners will have open access to complex databases developed during program implementation on the microbial patrimony of the network and the main systems, tools and technologies developed. Besides training through research performed during secondments of researchers to implement the above scientific activities, transfer of knowledge will be also achieved by summer schools, workshops and intensive virtual networking activities, covering not only scientific but also parallel sectors. Staff exchanges and networking activities between European and Indian and Brazilian research organisations will strengthen research partnerships. Dissemination of program results and best practices to external target groups to improve social acceptance and public perception of the new processes and materials and their exploitation in the market will be carried out.
100|grant.3794522|295709; 103966; FINLAB|Finance and Labor|Finance and Labor|How does financial market development affect employment, wages and unemployment risk? And how do labor market institutions and workers’ behavior in turn affect corporate policies?  These issues are much under-researched, in spite of their prominence in public debate, often ideologically polarized between those who consider finance as socially harmful and those who view it as an efficient allocation machine. Most economic research indicates that financial development raises output growth, but is silent about its effects on the labor market: does it also raise employment and wages? If so, is it at the expense of greater employment risk and inequality? And how does the potential for systemic financial instability affect the answers to these questions?  The study of these issues naturally opens also another – equally under-researched – line of inquiry: that concerning the effects of labor relations on financial arrangements. Do corporate investment policies and leverage decisions take into account their own effects on firms’ bargaining position in wage negotiations? And if so, how are these corporate decisions affected by job protection regulation, union density or workers’ protection in bankruptcy? To what extent do companies insure workers against employment risk, and do family and non-family firms differ in this respect? Finally, can labor market competition damage the performance of employees with decision-making responsibilities? For instance, can it induce managers or traders to take excessively risky decisions, by providing them with an escape route once they make mistakes, especially when outcomes are observed long after decisions?  This research project purports to break new ground on both sets of issues, using a combination of analytical modelling and empirical analysis, which in some cases will require the collection of entirely new data.

As an example, the 2010 eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull unleashed unprecedented air traffic chaos and, although it did not cause major direct losses, it nevertheless demonstrated how far-reaching the consequences of a natural catastrophe can be in our globalised world and that Europe was clearly not prepared for the consequences of such an eruption. Ash produced during explosive volcanic eruptions can be transported in the atmosphere for long times and distances during and after eruptive events, representing one of the most widespread hazards with several deadly consequences and the potential to significantly affect crucial economical sectors, such as transport, agriculture, social services, tourism and industry. The impact of the Eyjafjallajökull ash plume on European air space was mainly due to north to northwesterly winds from Iceland, which are atypical, but not unusual. Consequently there is a serious need to be better prepared in order to minimise impacts. We have chosen two case-study volcanoes, namely Eyjafjallajökull and Katla (Iceland), to compile a comprehensive characterisation of eruptive parameters (mainly height of the eruptive column, erupted mass, grainsize distribution and eruption duration) combined with a statistical analysis of eruption frequency and wind patterns in order to explore the likelihood of having disruptive volcanic events in the European region in the near future. A long-term hazard assessment focused on the transport systems will be compiled using state-of-the-art ash transport models (TEPHRA2 and FALL3D) and based on the prediction of both ash concentrations in the atmosphere and ground sedimentation resulting from the activity scenario derived for each case-study volcano. Finally, territorial vulnerability will also be investigated in order to compile a European-scale risk assessment. In particular, our territorial-vulnerability analysis will address both ground and aviation transport and the interdependence amongst various countries that could be affected by volcanic eruptions in the Atlantic region.

A relatively new broad-based and rapidly growing analytical technique, proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS), combines excellent chemical specification with ultra high detection sensitivity in real-time, but is only partially exploited owing to the lack of a focused research programme in terms of its scientific fundamentals and applications, and owing to a lack of an intersectoral and interdisciplinary based forum for the exchange of ideas and best practice to further develop PTR-MS.  The demand for PTR-MS is outstripping the supply of highly qualified chemists who cannot only use the technology, but who also have a broad background in analytical chemistry, and are capable of leading multidisciplinary research/commercial activities. There is an urgent need within Europe for the harmonized training of ESRs in analytical chemistry within many sectors and across many disparate scientific disciplines and applications. The overall goal of this multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary ITN is to train the next generation of analytical scientists in the skills necessary for the development and use of PTR-MS and other analytical technologies (including GC-MS, SIFT-MS and IMS) for the detection of trace gaseous compounds.  Our vision is to enhance our understanding of the crucial role these chemicals play in many complex chemical environments and the underpinning science needed to develop techniques to address major analytical challenges. The network is intersectoral in nature combining commercial (both manufacturers and “end-users”), governmental and academic concerns using a range of state-of-the-art analytical techniques, to address a number of topical analytical issues in an interdisciplinary cooperative.
100|grant.5148016|GUP11009|Development of the Italian National Registry for FSHD|Development of the Italian National Registry for FSHD|Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a common myopathy. The disease attacks peculiar muscles and patients are not able to close their eyes, blow their chicks, lift their arms and, eventually, may become wheelchair dependent. The disease has been associated to the reduction of a string of DNA elements, named D4Z4, that is located at the tip of chromosome 4 long arm. When the string of DNA is too short the disease appears. Molecular analysis allows counting the repeat number and is used for FSHD diagnosis. However, the disease can appear with different degree of severity and it is not clear how many individuals carrying the short string of DNA elements will develop the disease. Here we propose a study that analyze the Italian population of FSHD families with the intent of identifying factors that can influence the disease appearance. We expect this study will provide tools to predict the risk of developing a severe form of the disease. We also aim to identify factors that can help to prevent the disease worsening.This study will also consider patients showing FSHD clinical features without having the molecular defect with the aim of identifyig molecular markers useful for diagnosis. Finally, all clinical and molecular data will be collected in the National Registry of FSHD. The Registry will be available for distributing information to patients and clinicians and will be the basic frame of the FSHD netwok.

100|grant.8748181|NNJ12HB88I|Comparative Analysis of Charged Particle-Induced Autosomal Mutagenesis in Murine Tissue and Cells|Comparative Analysis of Charged Particle-Induced Autosomal Mutagenesis in Murine Tissue and Cells|Astronauts in space are exposed to a variety of charged particle radiations, some of which travel at very high velocities that can penetrate spacecraft, damage tissues, and increase the risk of cancer. This proposal addresses two cancer development processes, genomic instability and aneuploidy, links them to each other and to specific mechanisms of mutagenesis at an endogenous autosomal locus in epithelial cells. The aims proposed use a comparative biology approach and a transgenic mouse model that involves both in vitro and in situ approaches. This strategy enables quantitative, coupled analyses of early changes in cells that survive the exposure and a direct test of the relevance of these changes to the development of persistent changes in situ. The studies address the radiation quality dependence of genomic instability and aneuploidy focusing on charged particle beams spanning a critical LET (linear energy transfer) range from 25 keV/µm to 151 keV/µm, and will define the shape of the dose-response for these endpoints, particularly at low fluence. The rationale for working in this range of LET is the observation of increased biological effectiveness for cancer relevant endpoints in our previous studies, including mutagenesis in human and rodent cells, and work by others concerning Harderian gland tumorigenesis in mice. The investigations test the hypothesis that the induction of genomic instability and aneuploidy will increase as a function of ionization density for low fluence exposures, leading to genome-wide alterations in viable, mutant cells found in normal tissue. This project will define links between the processes that lead to early establishment of genomic instability, aneuploidy, and mechanisms of autosomal mutagenesis found in many kinds of human epithelial cancers. These quantitative, mechanism-based studies will aid in the extrapolation of results across species to help reduce the uncertainties in cancer risk projections for astronauts exposed to spaceflight radiations. This research examines the effects of charged particle radiations with different ionization densities using normal mammalian epithelium.  The research is designed to help determine links between cancer development processes at relatively low doses.  This work is of relevance to naturally occurring Earth-based exposures to densely ionizing radiations such as radon.  It will also inform our understanding of the mechanisms underlying potential risks to normal tissues associated with the implementation of charged particle radiation therapy. During the final year of funding we focused on analysis of Oxygen ion induced mutants (250 MeV/amu, LET = 25 keV/µm.  Results for 49 Aprt mutants arising following in vitro exposure to 1.6 Gy of O ions show that many exhibit radiation-signature mutations, including apparent mitotic recombination, multilocus deletion, and discontinuous loss of heterozygosity (LOH).  Small intragenic events were also found in this cohort, and at a higher proportion than in cohorts isolated after exposure to Si ions or Fe ions.  Such small events were more common following exposure to sparsely ionizing protons (1 GeV).  Taken together, there tends to be a trend toward larger, multilocus events as LET increases.  Intragenic events were also prevalent in primary kidney clones isolated after in situ exposure to a low dose of O ions (0.4 Gy), while deletions or discontinuous LOH events were rare.  However, there is evidence from analyses involving other chromosomes that O ions are capable of producing genome-wide rearrangements, similar to what we have observed for heavier ions.  Additional molecular analysis is ongoing.  In this final year, we also addressed three additional goals.  The first was to investigate the effect of dose-fractionation on genotoxic endpoints in cultured mouse kidney epithelial cells.  We examined cytotoxicity and Aprt mutation induction following an acute dose of Si ions (240 MeV/amu, LET = 78 keV/µm) or the same total dose administered in 4 daily fractions.  The study covered a dose range from 0-88 cGy.  For the fractionated study, the lower doses/fraction were 2.75 cGy and 5.5 cGy/day.  At these lower doses, the dose per fraction corresponded to either 0 or 1 particle traversal of a given cell nucleus.  The probabilities of >1 traversal by the central region of a Si ion track were extremely low.  Dose fractionation was not sparing with regard to cytotoxicity at any of the doses examined.  Furthermore, there was no sparing from the induction of Aprt mutants.  Taken together, the results indicate that the effects of heavy ion exposure are additive for the two endpoints examined in this model epithelium.   The second additional goal was to develop new technological approaches to the characterization of genome-wide events following exposure to charged particle radiation, e.g., a low to moderate fluence of Fe ions.  Earlier, we used PCR-based assays to follow the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) along mouse chromosome 8 using 13 markers arrayed along the chromosome.  We also used a similar approach to examine genome-wide changes in Aprt mutant colonies and in non-mutant clones.  Here we used single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analyses of the whole genome to examine a series of Aprt mutant and non-mutant samples that had been exposed to 0.25, 0.5, or 1 Gy of 1 GeV/amu Fe ions (lowest dose corresponds to an average of approximately 1 particle track/cell nucleus).  DNAs were subjected to comprehensive SNP analysis by a commercial vendor using an updated set of probes surveying 100,000 murine SNPs.  Roughly 23,000 of these SNPs were expected to be heterozygous on the B6D2F1 strain background.  Charts of individual chromosomes were devised to examine the extent of LOH in each of the DNAs submitted for analysis.  The results were generally in good agreement with the previous PCR-based analysis, but the level of coverage of the genome is much greater using the SNP approach.    The third additional goal was to implement a detailed breeding approach to develop a mouse strain to enable a linkage between autosomal mutagenesis and the induction of kidney tumors.  The plan was to devise a strain based on the B6D2F1 mouse model, where we have accumulated extensive knowledge regarding the quantitative and molecular aspects of charged particle-induced mutations in kidney epithelium.  The strategy included the use of a conditional allele for one of the genes that is known to predispose people to kidney cancer.  The breeding strategy was successful.

The increasing prevalence of anthelmintic resistance means that current control programmes are costly and unsustainable in the long term. Recent changes in the epidemiology, seasonality and geographic distribution of helminth infections have been attributed to climate change. However, other changes in environment (e.g. land use) and in livestock farming, such as intensification and altered management practices, will also have an impact on helminth infections. Sustainable control of helminth infections in a changing world requires detailed knowledge of these interactions. GLOWORM will devise new, sustainable strategies for the effective control of ruminant helminthoses in the face of global change. We will: (1) optimise diagnosis, by developing novel, high-throughput diagnostic tests for mixed helminth infections, sub-clinical infections and anthelmintic resistance, (2) map, monitor and predict the impact of global change on parasite epidemiology, leading to spatial risk maps and improved forecasting of disease, (3) produce predictive models to identify optimal future intervention strategies, (4) identify and mitigate the economic impacts of infections and (5) involve end-users in the production and dissemination of detailed advice for effective worm control.

Technologies include genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, laser scanning cytometry, NMR based lipoprotein profiling and advanced imaging by MRI/MRS.  All methods will be applied in an integrated manner to quantify the effect of diet on “phenotypic flexibility”, based on metabolic flexibility (the capacity for the organism to adapt fuel oxidation to fuel availability). However, NutriTech will move beyond the state-of-the-art by applying these integrated methods to assess the underlying and related cell biological and genetic mechanisms and multiple physiological processes of adaptation when homeostasis is challenged. Methods will in the first instance be evaluated within a human intervention study, and the resulting optimal methods will be validated in a number of existing cohorts against established endpoints.  NutriTech will disseminate the harmonised and integrated technologies on a global scale by a large academic network including 6 non-EU partners and by providing an integrated and standardised data storage and evaluation platform. The impact of NutriTech will be multifold and exploitation is crucial as major breakthroughs from our technology and research are expected. This will be achieved by collaboration with a consortium of 8 major food industries and by exploitation of specific technologies by our 6 SME partners. Overall, NutriTech will lay the foundations for successful integration of emerging technologies intro nutrition research.

Arterial obstruction due to arteriosclerosis is the cause of a wide spectrum of diseases, disabilities and death, because of induced ischemia in feed arteries of the diseased organs. These organs include the brain (ischemic stroke), the heart , the kidneys, the gastrointestinal tract, the lower limbs (leading to amputations, especially in diabetic patients). The purpose of the in vivo tissue engineered (TE) blood vessel is to offer an alternative treatment for patients affected with this disease: to substitute the actual mechanical, acute oriented “rechanneling” or “by passing” of obstructed arteries with a regenerative, physiological, disease solving and long term oriented, approach in the therapy of ischemic cardiovascular disease, compatible with today minimal invasive surgical techniques. This is an unexplored area of approaches of therapy for arterial obstruction by TE technology: the substitution of the diseased arterial intima (atherosclerotic plaque removed) with an absorbable bioactive scaffold, called the synthesized intimal layer (SIL), to be repopulated by resident and circulating patient resident and stem cells. SIL does not intend to stent the artery; conversely it aims to replace the diseased and stiffened area with a soft and compliant intelligent scaffold that becomes reabsorbed once its task is completed , leaving a physiologically responsive regenerated tissue. The project aims to merge the single laboratories ongoing work, coordinate it and finalizing it to bring it through the whole pre clinical process, including the whole regulatory work, the GLP animal pre clinical implants and the design and production of “TE device” deployment technology."""

The envisioned joint research program is of broad commercial interest and will be an important contribution to the efforts undertaken world-wide to ensure future stability of food production in view of the prognosticated global climate change. Although the initial focus will be on tomato as an important agricultural crop, the results are expected to become applicable to other cultivated plants in the long run. Based on individual research projects of the young researchers, the main focus of the network will be to perform common, multidisciplinary experiments on a broad variety of heat-sensitive and heat-tolerant tomato genotypes and mutant lines at the molecular, cellular and organismic level with two major objectives: i) to describe the molecular basis of the striking sensitivity of pollen development at higher temperatures and regulation of pollen-specific heat stress response and thermotolerance mechanisms; and ii) to develop BIOMARKERS of POLLEN THERMOTOLERANCE usable in future screening programs to improve breeding of new heat-tolerant cultivars. Besides training of specific research tasks, the multi-disciplinary research program includes advanced methods and high-throughput technologies in plant genetics, molecular and cell biology, physiology, and bioinformatics. In addition, a multitude of opportunities are provided for training complementary skills to broaden the knowledge of the young researchers for developing their future career with comprehensive possibilities in a wide field of research areas in Life Sciences in both, the public and the private sector.

DMD patients suffer from severe, progressive muscle wasting, with clinical symptoms first detected at 2-5 years of age. As the disease progresses, patients are confined to a wheelchair in their teens and die in their early 20s from cardiopulmonary failure. Despite years of intense research, there is still no effective treatment or cure for DMD. The active thyroid hormone (T3) derives either directly from thyroid secretion or by the deiodination of the prohormone thyroxine (T4) by one of two enzymes, the deiodinases D1 and D2. Much of the T3 derived from D2, the only activating-deiodinase expressed in muscle, remains within the cell. A third member of the deiodinase family, D3, has an opposing function, catalyzing the inactivation of both T4and T3. Taken together, the actions of the three deiodinases constitute a potent mechanism for regulation of thyroid hormone action at the cellular level. Stem cells are frequently being used as tools in regenerative medicine and drug discovery. Our preliminary data clearly indicate that D2 in the stem cells is an essential component of the myogenic program in muscle development and regeneration. The general objective of this proposal is to dissect the role of thyroid hormone signaling in the control of stem cells biology. Through the study of genetically manipulated mouse lines and primary culture of stem cells, it aims to alter thyroid hormone concentrations in the muscle stem cell with a therapeuticalobjective in DMD context. This work will provide novel insights into the previously unrecognized role of deiodinases in the myogenic program in physiological and pathological settings. In addition it will set the stage to use hormonal regulation as a tool to manipulate at will the physiology of muscle stem cell, modulatingtheir expansion and differentiation in the mdx mouse in a therapeutical context.

The short term perspective is to develop and implement a real time process control system that eliminates the production of any faulty component due to variances in materials, components and process properties. The long term perspective is to minimize all failures by continuous optimizing of the production process and the manufacturing system. A framework of an Intelligent Fault Correction and self Optimizing Manufacturing system (IFaCOM) will be developed, which can become a general framework for manufacturing equipment and processes for different industrial branches. In this framework it is proposed to extend the use of closed loop control to all vital parameters of a component or product. In today's manufacturing it is still the case that many vital parameters are controlled indirectly, thus creating a larger variability in the output than acceptable within the zero-defect paradigm. The project will create a basic understanding of the method of direct closed loop control of vital parameters and apply this control principle both to single operations and to the entire part manufacturing process in order to eliminate the propagation of defects along the process stages. The principles can be extended to processes where the input material has too large variability leading to high defect rates in production. This involves both the development of suitable measurement and monitoring techniques of the input condition of components as well as development of the necessary actuation methods and mechanisms to implement the necessary control actions. To establish and continuously improve the closed loop methods and to extend them over the entire process chain of part manufacturing, the control models must be upgraded in accordance with the increased insight in the operations that can be obtained by analysis of large amounts of data available from multiple sensors both in the manufacturin

Inspired by these results, SAPHARI will perform a fundamental paradigm shift in robot development in the sense that we place the human as the centre of the entire design. We address all essential aspects of safe, intuitive physical interaction between humans and complex, human-like robotic systems in a strongly interconnected manner. While encompassing safety issues based on biomechanical analysis, human-friendly hardware design, and interaction control strategies, the project will develop and validate perceptive and cognitive key components that enable robots to track, understand and predict human motions in a weakly structured dynamic environment in real-time. Apart from developing the necessary capabilities for interactive autonomy, we will tightly incorporate the human safety also at the cognitive level. This will enable the robots to react or physically interact with humans in a safe and autonomous way. Biomechanical knowledge and biologically motivated variable compliance actuators will be used to design bimanual manipulation systems close to human properties and performance. Planning motions and tasks of such complex systems in real-time require new concepts, including tight coupling of control and planning, that lead to new reactive action generation behaviours.  Moreover, self explaining interaction and communication frameworks will be developed to enhance the system usability. The project focuses on two industrial use cases that explicitly require contacts and force exchange in human-robot co-work, as well as on professional service scenarios in hospitals, in which a medical staff and an assisting robot interact closely during daily work. Results of this project are expected to strongly impact all applications where interactive robots can assist humans and release them from dangerous or routine tasks.

100|grant.2751181|BB/I013164/1|Molecular basis of algal-bacterial interactions and its implications for industrial cultivation of microalgae|Molecular basis of algal-bacterial interactions and its implications for industrial cultivation of microalgae|The World is faced with the considerable challenge of supplementing, and ultimately replacing, its fossil fuel-based economy with one based on clean energy technologies such as biofuels. Currently, commercially available biofuels (e.g. bioethanol and biodiesel) are derived from crop plants such as maize and soybean. However, there are major concerns regarding both the use of valuable agricultural land for production of biofuel crops, and the sustainability and energy balance of such technologies. A potential alternative source of biofuels is microalgae - aquatic photosynthetic organisms that do not require fertile land for cultivation; grow considerably faster than plants, and which can accumulate significant quantities of high-energy compounds such as oils. Furthermore, such aquatic cultivation could be coupled to waste streams such as CO2 output from industry and nutrient-rich effluent, thereby using this waste to promote algal growth. However, industrial-scale cultivation of microalgae for biofuels faces considerable challenges, not just in terms of technical feasibility, but also in terms of economics and achieving a net positive energy balance. In particular, although the best rates of productivity of suitable strains are achieved in enclosed tubular systems, called photobioreactors, the energy requirement for building and operating these facilities is much greater than that in the fuel that is extracted. In contrast, growth in open raceway ponds generally results in energy savings compared to fossil-derived diesel. On the other hand, open ponds are at great risk from contamination by bacteria, viruses or competing algae. Crop protection is therefore a key issue that must be addressed to allow effective and productive commercialisation of algae. We have discovered an interaction between microalgae and bacteria that might provide a means to assist in this crop protection. Over half of all species of microalgae require vitamin B12 for growth - and they can obtain it from bacteria, in return for sugars made from photosynthesis. We have identified a possible explanation for why so many algae need this vitamin - it appears that loss of a particular gene, called METE, changes an alga from being effectively a 'hunter-gatherer', using B12 if it is available, to a 'subsistence farmer', needing to cultivate bacteria to ensure a proper supply of this vitamin. This suggests that there must be ways in which the two organisms signal to one another, and also that there is some advantage to this lifestyle, since it is so prevalent. In this project we will test our hypothesis, and determine if the growth of algae and bacteria together in cocultures affect the productivity of fuel molecules in the algal cells, and if it prevents contamination by invasive species. We will also use several molecular approaches to identify genes and proteins that might be involved in this interaction, in particular in the uptake of B12 by the algal cells.  Technical Summary We propose a three-year project that will address a key bottleneck in the cultivation of microalgae on an industrial scale, namely the need to devise strategies to deal with contamination of cultures. We will build on our discovery of mutualistic interactions between microalgae and bacteria, in which the bacteria supply vitamin B12 to the algae in return for fixed carbon. Over half of all microalgal species have an absolute requirement for the vitamin for growth, indicating that they are dependent on this interaction. We have evidence from algal genome sequence data that whether or not an alga is a B12-auxotroph is determined by the absence or presence, respectively, of the gene for METE (a B12-independent form of methionine synthase). We have established a model system to study the interaction using Lobomonas rostrata, a close relative of the model green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and the soil bacterium Mesorhizobium loti. We have embarked on sequencing the Lobomonas transcriptome; M. loti MAFF3030099 genome is already known. Thus the model system is tractable at the molecular level. We will use molecular, biochemical and physiological approaches to build on the preliminary work we have done to: (i) begin identification of genes involved in establishing and maintaining the interaction between algae and B12-producing bacteria, and to test the hypothesis that loss of the METE gene converts 'hunter-gatherers' (ie algae such as Chlamydomonas that use B12 if it is available) to 'subsistence farmers' (ie algal B12-auxotrophs such as Lobomonas that must cultivate interactions with B12-producing bacteria); (ii) investigate components of the B12 uptake and recognition in Lobomonas; and (iii) test whether cocultures confer advantages in terms of productivity of the fuel molecules (ie triacylglycerides), and resistance to invasive species.

It addresses aircraft weight and operational cost reductions as well as an improvement in the flight profile specific aerodynamic performance. This concerns material concepts enabling a conformal, controlled distortion of aerodynamically important surfaces, material concepts enabling an active or passive status assessment of specific airframe areas with respect to shape and potential damages and material concepts enabling further functionalities which to date have been unrealizable. Past research has shown the economic feasibility and system maturity of aerodynamic morphing. However, few projects concerned themselves with the challenges arising from the structural integration on commercial aircraft. In particular the skin material and its bonding to the substructure is challenging. It is the aim of this project proposal to demonstrate the structural realizability of individual morphing concepts concerning the leading edge, the trailing edge and the winglet on a full-size external wing by aerodynamic and structural testing. Operational requirements on morphing surfaces necessitate the implementation of an independent, integrated shape sensing system to ensure not only an optimal control of the aerodynamic surface but also failure tolerance and robustness. Developments made for structural health monitoring will be adapted to this task. Similar systems optimized for rapid in-service damage assessment have progressed to a maturity which allows their inclusion in the next generation of aircraft. However, the time consuming application of these sensor systems has to be further improved by integration at the component manufacturing level. The additional benefit of a utilization of these adapted systems for part manufacture process and quality control shall be assessed in SARISTU. Addressing the Nanotechnology aspect of the call, benefits regarding significant damage tolerance and electrical conductivity improvements shall be realized at sub-assembly level.

In spite of the large contribution to air pollution by maritime transport, this sector has remained largely unregulated until now. The adoption of the new restrictive IMO emission regulations requires modification of the entire commercial fleet that has to be retrofitted with innovative solutions.  The aim of this project is to create a novel, modular, on-board, after-treatment unit that combines different sub-units, each of which is optimized to remove a specific primary pollutant (SOx, NOx, PM – including BC, VOC, and CO). This new integrated retrofit system will reduce the environmental footprint of existing and new ships well below the limits imposed by the current and envisaged future regulations, while giving EU marine industry a competitive edge.  The system must be designed to avoid or minimise the use of external chemicals, and promote the use of reliable and robust technologies to allow easy maintenance and fast retrofit. The proposal considers the use of innovative processes for the treatment of each pollutant: i) a new concept of Electrostatic Seawater Scrubbing to capture submicron PM, SO2 and other water soluble compounds and ii) an innovative Non Thermal Plasma Reactor, using Electron Beam and Microwave, to remove NOx, VOC and CO. It is envisaged that these two processes are sufficient to successfully remove all gaseous pollutants from ship exhaust. However, if needed, in the final stage, state-of-the-art Selective Catalytic Reduction or NOx Storage Reduction will be implemented for residual NOx removal.

100|grant.2758683|BB/I014691/1|Exploiting the growth promotion and induced resistance properties of Trichoderma hamatum for improved crop productivity.|Exploiting the growth promotion and induced resistance properties of Trichoderma hamatum for improved crop productivity.|With the human population projected to reach 9 billion by the year 2050, unsustainable demands will be placed on global agriculture to meet future food requirements. Improvements in crops yields that have traditionally relied on plant breeding and energy intensive agriculture are unlikely to meet these needs and therefore marginal land, previously considered unsuitable for agriculture, will need to be brought into cultivation. Much of this land will have sub-optimal fertility and nutrient-poor soils requiring substantial inputs of synthetic fertilizers to support sustainable crop production. However, significant increases in the price of fertilizers mean many farmers, particularly in developing countries, cannot afford such management practises. The spiraling financial burden of fertilizers, combined with growing public anxiety of the environmental and health impacts of synthetic chemical additives, means that alternative strategies for sustainable crop production need to be examined urgently. Trichoderma strains produce a diverse array of secondary metabolites and secreted proteins. Trichoderma isolates have been shown to activate broad spectrum immunity, ameliorate a wide range of abiotic stresses such as salinity and drought, improve photosynthetic efficiency, enhance nutrient uptake, and significantly increase nitrogen use efficiency in crops. These important attributes can all contribute to the enhanced plant growth characteristics often evident upon inoculation. The positive agronomic traits of growth promotion, enhanced tolerance to abiotic stress and broad spectrum enhanced systemic immunity afforded by many Trichoderma strains are striking and unique. The ability to exploit the signaling networks activated by Trichoderma to establish these agriculturally beneficial traits requires an understanding of both the bioactive inducing molecules and the signaling networks targeted by these activators. The rapid developments in genomic and analytical technologies means this is an opportune time to exploit the amazing chemical diversity of soil micro-organisms such as Trichoderma, with the objective of improving PGP and ISR on a range of agronomically important plant species. Research conducted at Exeter has identified a novel strain of the naturally occurring rhizosphere fungus Trichoderma hamatum (strain GD12) that improves crop productivity and imparts broad spectrum enhanced immunity to pathogens in the absence of costly fertilizers and environmentally damaging agrochemicals. At present, the mechanism underlying the plant-growth-promotion and enhanced systemic resistance phenomena are unknown and this proposal lays the foundations to address the molecular basis of the inducing bioactives and the plant response pathways targeted by these bioactives. This combined knowledge is important, and necessary to contemplate translating Trichoderma PGP and ISR into the agricultural arena. This multidisciplinary research programme will use a combination of genetics, genomics and metabolomics to unravel Trichoderma PGP/ISR bioactives, capture the plant transcriptional reprogramming induced by the bioactives and identify key components of the PGP, ISR signaling networks. We will use comparative transcriptomics to characterize signaling pathways in Arabidopsis and rice activated by Trichoderma inoculation. In combination with mutant Trichoderma and Arabidopsis lines compromised in phytohormone signaling we will identify candidate signaling components/pathways that contribute to PGP and ISR. We will undertake comparative metabolic profiling using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry to characterize the bioactives and test their efficacy on different plants with the objective of developing novel natural agrochemicals.  Technical Summary Trichoderma strains produce a diverse array of secondary metabolites and secreted proteins meaning there is enormous agrochemical potential to exploit these key agronomic traits. Work at Exeter has disrupted hexosaminidase activity in T. hamatum, an enzyme involved in chitin de-polymerisation and release of sequestered nitrogen for plant growth, and an enzyme thought to be key to plant growth promotion (PGP) activity of a strain of the fungus (strain GD12). Contrary to our expectations, disruption of enzyme production dramatically enhanced PGP by the fungus leading to a further significant increase in plant growth. Strikingly, this mutant strain caused different PGP responses compared to GD12 on Arabidopsis mutants compromised in phytohormone signaling. What is clear from our preliminary studies, is that both transcriptional and genetic data indicate that T. hamatum responses differ from conventional JA/ET dependencies reported in the literature. Therefore, understanding the mechanistic basis of T. hamatum PGP/ISR is clearly of both fundamental and strategic interest. The aim of this proposal is to unravel the host signaling networks activated in systemic foliar tissue following T. hamatum infection. These pathways are expected to provide a mechanistic insight into both PGP potential and systemic enhanced resistance. In parallel we will undertake a detailed comparative metabolic profiling of the T. hamatum secretome to identify bioactive compounds responsible for PGP and ISR. We outline a multidisciplinary proposal that exploits the rapid developments in genomic and analytical technologies to (i) examine the nature of the bioactive inducers in the mutant and GD12 Trichoderma lines, (ii) identify the plant signaling networks activated by these bioactive compounds through comparative transcriptomics in Arabidopsis mutant lines, and between Arabidopsis and rice undergoing PGP/ISR responses and (iii) characterise key plant regulatory component of this pathway.
100|grant.3782300|293727; 99900; SAFES|Service Assessment and Failure of Earth Structures|Service Assessment and Failure of Earth Structures|In unsaturated soils, pores are filled partly by water and partly by air. Unsaturated soils occur naturally (as superficial ground above the water table) or in manmade structures (as compacted earth in infrastructure embankments, underground nuclear waste repositories and flood defences). Unsaturated soil mechanics has experienced significant advances during recent years, instigated by the use of compacted earth as sustainable building material and by the pressing need of the construction industry to improve techniques for management and appraisal of earth structures. Seminal contributions to unsaturated soil mechanics have been made over the past two decades but the current state-of-the-art is still unable to provide an accurate understanding of pre-failure behaviour in compacted soils, which is crucial to ensure long-term serviceability and cost-effective maintenance of earth structures. Mechanical non-linerarity and dependency of small strain stiffness, as well as damping, on stress history are important properties not properly described by existing constitutive models. Understanding the response of compacted soils at small strains is not only central to applications in engineering dynamics, such as predicting ground motion during earthquakes or next to high-speed railways, but also to the analysis of earth structures under static loads of service. The proposed project will contribute to fill such gaps of knowledge by pursuing two intertwined lines of investigations. Firstly, it will undertake a wide-ranging testing programme on samples compacted both in the laboratory and in-situ following standard procedures to ensure comparable material fabrics. Secondly, it will validate a constitutive model capable of describing mechanical behaviour from small to large strains and finally it will implement the model in a finite element code to analize the behaviour on an earth structure under service and failure conditions and compare simulation results with field monitoring.

CMT is a clinically heterogeneous neuropathy, characterised by the cardinal clinical features of distal wasting, weakness and sensory loss with reduced tendon reflexes and variable foot deformity. CMT1A is the most frequent subtype, and is due to the excessive expression of the peripheral myelin protein PMP22.X-linked CMT is the second most common form and is associated with mutations in the gap-junction protein beta 1 gene on chromosome Xq13.1 encoding for connexin 32 protein.CMT1B is associated with mutations in the myelin protein zero. At least 200 patients will be recruited in this study. The aim of this project is to evaluate the reliability and validity of two clinical tools, 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and StepWatchTM Activity Monitor (SAM), in CMT disease. These measures, that havenever been used in CMT patients, most likely well reflect patient's activities of daily living and appear to be promising to detect clinically meaningful changes in future therapeutic trials. We also wish to examine the relationship among 6MWT and SAM and other four measures already validated in CMT1A population (10 meter walking test, CMTNeuropathy score, the MVIC of upper and lower limb muscle groups by hand-held myometry and SF-36). The study will allow to compare the sensitivity of all these tools, to select the most appropriate outcome measures in this disorder and to collect longitudinal data over a 1-year period in a relatively large cohort of ambulant CMT patients, including three different genetic subtypes.

DOLPHIN aims at developing new tools providing effective improvements of the state-of-the-art capabilities in Maritime Surveillance with respect to Users’ real needs in particular through filling their present technological gaps. The identification of these technological gaps is made easier by the fact that the DOLPHIN partners have developed a solid experience through a number of past and on going initiatives, such as LIMES, MARISS, MarCoast, EMSA CSN, in which a wide European Users community in the Maritime Surveillance sector has already taken an active part in identifying application needs and technological gaps. DOLPHIN will respond to the specific Users need, focused on Users’ missions, through the development of Decision Support Modules (DSM) which will integrate innovative Software Tools, aiming at filling the identified technological gaps according to specific policy-driven requirements and scenarios. Five policy areas have been selected as being in most need of improvement: Border Surveillance,  Traffic Safety, Environmental Protection, Fisheries Control and Search and Rescue. Each policy area has categories of users that are quite different, so each policy area will be addressed through a specific DSM. Users will play an important role in the consolidation of the operational scenarios, to ensure that they are significant and representative of the complexity of the requirements. They will also be involved in the validation of the Operational Scenarios, when modules will be integrated in operational Services Chains and their actual effectiveness will be measured on the basis of the given definition.

PROMETHEUS builds on the previous EU projects HEATOX and ICARE. Its aims are (1) to understand the dynamics of formation of major Processing Contaminants, (2) to provide on-line real time methods to monitor reactions leading to contaminant formation, (3) to develop new processing technologies to mitigate contaminants but maintain the safety and sensory properties of the food and (4) to demonstrate scaling the new technologies to the industry level. Foods (infant formulas, biscuits, canned baby foods, and canned fish and vegetables) have been chosen for their nutritional importance. Processing contaminants (acrylamide, 3-monochloropropanediol esters, glycidol esters, furan, hydroxymethylfurfural and carboxymethyllysine) have been chosen for their toxicity, consumer exposure and relevance to the foods. PROMETHEUS will use a novel holistic approach of continuous real-time on-line monitoring of contaminant formation during food processing. Ambient mass spectrometry, fluorescence spectroscopy and image analysis will measure the contaminants simultaneously and allow modelling of the reactions that form contaminants and affect food quality. Innovative processing technologies will be used: vacuum baking, high hydrostatic pressure, ohmic heating, and ingredient microencapsulation. Improvement strategies will be demonstrated at industry level. The PROMETHEUS consortium has 8 research organisations and 6 industrial partners (including 4 SMEs, 1 large company and the European Confederation of Agro Food industries). The project outcome will help to protect the consumer. It will improve the competitiveness of the food industry by anticipating future contamination regulations, and help it to innovate by implementing new technologies in order to better control the safety and overall quality of their products.

This presents a market opportunity for rail freight to grow, partly due to increasing congestion on roads, and mainly due to the need for reliable and environment friendly transport of goods. At the same time, to meet customer requirements, rail freight has to rise to the challenge of needing to be reliable and available, as well as complying with other market demands. Depending on the market segment these may be faster transport time, specialised goods systems, tracking and tracing, greater flexibility, lower prices or premium services. Furthermore in congested situations rail freight may have a competitive advantage compared to other modes of traffic.SPECTRUM will develop a railfreight train that provides a higher speed service for high value, low density and time sensitive goods with the performance characteristics of a passenger train. SPECTRUM takes a longer term, radical and first principles approach to deliver a new railfreight offering that can compete with road and air in the growing sectors of logistics where railfreight has traditionally little to offer. We shall work towards a freight train that: Behaves like a passenger train in terms of speed, acceleration, braking, momentum: allowing full scheduling on urban and sub urban train networks;Has a standardised and universal power supply system for the delivery of power to temperature controlled containers (reefers) in a controllable fashion.

The clinical manifestation of the disease are a severe cardiomypathy and progressive muscle weakness. At present a treatment is available for PD, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), based on the periodic intravenous infusion of recombinant human GAA (rhGAA). However, ERT, although successful in reverting cardiac involvement and improving muscle function in some patients, has limitations. Specifically, correction of the enzyme defect and of function in skeletal muscle is insufficient in several patients.We propose the combined use of a novel therapeutic approach, enzyme enhancement therapy (EET) with pharmacological chaperones, and ERT. We recently provided the rationale for this approach in collaboration with TIGEM.In this study we propose to treat PD patients followed at four Italian centers involved in the care of metabolic disease with ERT and the pharmacological chaperone NB-DNJ (Miglustat, Zavesca), already approved for clinical use for a different indication. As short-term endpoints we plan to see whether the combination of these approaches can increase the efficacy of ERT.This study may provide the proof that combination therapies are more effective in correcting the enzymatic deficiency of a debilitating genetic disorder, such as PD. This model may be extended to other lysosomal diseases in which ERT is available, but has limited efficacy.
100|grant.2775685|EP/I019308/1|Innovation Knowledge Centre for Smart Infrastructure and Construction|Innovation Knowledge Centre for Smart Infrastructure and Construction|Infrastructure is a large part of the UK's assets. Efficient management and maintenance of infrastructure are vital to the economy and society. The application of emerging technologies to advanced health monitoring of existing critical infrastructure assets will quantify and define the extent of ageing and the consequent remaining design life of infrastructure, thereby reducing the risk of failure. Emerging technologies will also transform the industry through a whole-life approach to achieving sustainability in construction and infrastructure in an integrated way - design and commissioning, the construction process, exploitation and use, and eventual de-commissioning. Crucial elements of these emerging technologies will be the application of the latest sensor technologies, data management tools and manufacturing processes to the construction industry, both during infrastructure construction and throughout its design life. There will be a very substantial market for exploitation of these technologies by the construction industry, particularly contractors, specialist instrumentation companies and owners of infrastructure.In this proposal, we seek to create the Innovation and Knowledge Centre for Smart Infrastructure and Construction that will bring together four leading research groups in the Cambridge Engineering Department and the Computer Laboratory (sensors, computing, manufacturing engineering and civil engineering), along with staff in other faculties - the Judge Business School and the Department of Architecture. The Centre will develop and commercialise emerging technologies which will provide radical changes in the construction and management of infrastructure, leading to considerably enhanced efficiencies, economies and adaptability. We propose to create 'Smart Infrastructure' with the following attributes: (a) minimal disturbance and maximum efficiency during construction, (b) minimal maintenance for new infrastructure and optimum management of existing infrastructure, (c) minimal failures even during extreme events (fire, natural hazards, climate change), and (d) minimal waste materials at the end of the life cycle. The IKC will focus on the innovative use of emerging technologies in sensor and data management (e.g. fibre optics, MEMS, computer vision, power harvesting, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and Wireless Sensor Networks). These will be coupled with emerging best practice in the form of the latest manufacturing and supply chain management approaches applied to construction and infrastructure (e.g. smart building components for life-cycle adaptive design, innovative manufacturing processes, integrated supply chain management, and smart management processes from building to city scales). It will aim to develop completely new markets and achieve breakthroughs in performance.The business opportunities in construction and infrastructure are very considerable, not only for construction companies but also for other industries such as IT, electronics and materials. The IKC is designed to respond directly and systematically to the input received from industry partners on what is required to address this issue. Through the close involvement of industry in technical development as well as in demonstrations in real construction projects, the commercialisation activities of emerging technologies will be progressed during the project to a point where they can be licensed to industry. The outputs of the IKC will provide the construction industry, infrastructure owners and operators with the means to ensure that very challenging new performance targets can be met. Furthermore the potential breakthroughs will make the industry more efficient and hence more profitable. They will also give UK companies a competitive advantage in the increasingly global construction market.

Allerdings ist der Zusammenhang von Elektrodengeometrie und –aktivität noch weitgehend unverstanden. Das liegt unter anderem an oftmals schlecht definierten Elektrodenstrukturen. Bis jetzt stellte die Herstellung und Untersuchung von geordneten Nanostrukturen für effiziente elektrochemische Systeme eine große Herausforderung dar: Durch elektrochemische Abscheidung erhält man Nanopartikel mit variierender Größe und variierendem Abstand. Auch die Erzeugung von einzelnen Nanopartikeln mittels elektrochemischem Rastertunnelmikroskop (EC-STM) ist limitiert durch die geringe Fläche (einige μm2), die strukturiert werden kann. Unser Vorhaben verbindet Nanostrukturierungstechniken mit der Elektrokatalyse, um den Einfluss der Elektrodengeometrie auf die Elektrodenaktivität zu quantifizieren. Mit Hilfe von nanostrukturierten Stempeln werden metallische Strukturen (Au, Pd und Pt) auf flache Substrate aufgebracht und als Elektroden zur Messung elektrokatalytischer Aktivitäten verwendet. Zwei verschiedene Strukturierungstechniken, Nanotransfer-Druck (nanotransfer printing, nTP) und Nanoimprint-Lithographie (nanoimprint lithographie, NIL), ermöglichen eine gezielte Variation der Parameter (Durchmesser, Höhe und Abstand der Nanostrukturen) im Bereich von 5-250 nm.

Zwei oder mehr Metallfilme oder Linien, welche durch ein derartiges „Nanogap“ voneinander getrennt sind, sollen als elektrische Kontakte an organische Moleküle dienen. In einem von zwei Ansätzen des Vorhabens werden zunächst Si/SiO2 Substrate mit organischen, dünnen Filmen („self-assembled monolayers“) aus Antrazen-haltigen Organophosphonaten beschichtet. Anschließend werden die metallischen Source- und Drainkontakte auf diese molekulare Schischt gedruckt, wodurch ein organischer Ultra-Dünnschicht-Transistor mit extrem kurzer Kanallänge entsteht. Im zweiten, wesentlichen Ansatz planen wir die Untersuchung großer, konjugierter Moleküle (Oligo-Phenylen-Ethynylene, OPE), welche eine Sternartige, verzweigte Struktur aufweisen, um einen molekularen Transisitor zu realisieren. Die Moleküle sollen aus Lösung auf Drei-Terminal-Nanogapelektroden abgeschieden werden. Derartige Kontaktstrukturen werden mit einer Erweiterung unserer nTP-Technik, dem Überwachsen von Spaltkanten („Cleaved Edge Overgrowth“, CEO) hergestellt.

Die elektrischen Eigenschaften der geplanten Bauelemente-Typen werden in Hinblick auf ihre Abhängigkeit vom transferierten Metall (elektronische Austrittsarbeit), von der Source-Drain-Kanallänge, von der molekularen, elektronischen Struktur, der Temperatur, vom elektrischen Gate- Potential und vom einfallenden Licht (Photoleitfähigkeit) untersucht. Zur Ergänzung der experimentellen Aktivitäten sollen ausgedehnte Rechnungen der molekularen Transporteigenschaften auf der Grundlage unterschiedlicher Methoden durchgeführt werden.

In attempting to cope with these sudden changes and upheavels, the local urban communities continually found themselves faced by the need to legitimize and reconfirm their status through actual negotiations with the king, and eventually with the baron. In this context the procedures and methods used to construct specific local identities take on particular importance, as do those used by individuals and families to affirm their social position. Through an interdisciplinary team the project seeks to identify the conscious and strategic use of archival and literary sources, and of local antiquities, in methods of self-representation adopted by the elite and by the local communities in the Regno di Napoli between the medieval and early modern period beginning with Campania and then extending to Puglia, Calabria, Lucania, Molise and Abruzzo. The aim of the project is to establish a balanced view of southern continental Italy and to create new instruments which will improve not only international academic knowledge but can benefit civil society as a whole, as well as institutions in laying the foundations for a new conservation strategy to protect and manage the cultural patrimony of southern Italy, a region which has contributed significantly to the formation of a European identity. An accessible database on the Internet will be specifically designed and programmed to gather together all the data from this research pre-requisite for studying such themes, and will provide a new instrument and new prospects of research for scholars world-wide.

One type of spectroscopy in particular, Raman spectroscopy, has proven especially useful in providing detailed chemical composition of biological samples, constituting a sort of its chemical fingerprint. However the limited spatial resolution and sensitivity available is not sufficient to be able to resolve sub-cellular species. Furthermore, studies are normally performed on multiple cells grown or fixed on a surface which leaves a question about the influence of surface adhesion and cell to cell heterogeneities and interactions upon the biochemical state of the cells studied. Quantitative imaging and analysis of single normal and diseased cells is a challenging analytical goal. The principal objective of this project is to develop further a biophotonics technique that combine novel Raman spectroscopy methods with Optical Tweezers and apply this technique in obtaining time- and space-resolved information on biochemical and biophysical reactions inside single healthy and diseased living cells.In order to detect the distribution of assigned chemicals within a single selected cell, without physically touching it or needing to absorb it to a surface, it will be developed a new wide field spectral Raman imaging based on the use of Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) combined with an Optical Cell Rotator (OCR). This system will allow the acquisition of several spectra simultaneously from a large uniform area of interest of the optically trapped cell and incredibly will reduce the required acquisition time. So far, single living cells and subcellular compartments can be molecularly examined rapidly, non-invasively, without the use of external markers or fluorescent dyes and free from the interferences with the other cells.Although Raman spectroscopy is a useful technique to identify and quantify the biochemical composition of a cell, it can be severely limited in its applicability by sensitivity limits. Recently, numerous Raman based techniques have been developed in order to enhance the sensitivity of the basic technique. Among these, Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) is a process whereby the Raman scattering is enhanced, up to 14 orders of magnitude, when a Raman-active molecule is close to a metallic nanoparticle. Taking advantages from the major characteristics of both these new ultra-sensitive spectroscopic techniques (wide-field Raman imaging and SERS), it will be possible . to determine where assignment biochemical transformations occur on malignant cell membrane with spatial resolution of a few nanometers and sensitivity up to single molecules. All that has relevant implication for diagnostic and therapy of many diseases.Other important information can be obtained correlating such malignant biochemical transformations with the mechanical structure of normal and diseased cells. Recently, it has been demonstrated that mechanical stress can modify the protein expression in cancer cells membrane and consequently their susceptibility to the immune system detection. In particular, the project will focalize on the spectroscopic study of stress induced specific proteins in the various cellular compartments. This will require the development of micromanipulation apparatus (Optical Stretcher) that will be integrated with the ultra-sensitive spectroscopic techniques. Micromanipulation techniques will allow selecting a single cell and applying controlled mechanical stress (stretching) on it and ultra-sensitive spectroscopic techniques will allow the direct measurement of changes at molecular level (protein expression, cytoskeleton re-organization, etc.) that are directly related with mechanical stress.

Through close co-operation between industrial and academic partners, the MAREX project will collect, isolate and classify marine organisms, such as micro- and macroalgae, cyanobacteria, sea anemones, tunicates and fish from the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans as well as from the Mediterranean, Baltic and Arabian Seas. Extracts and purified compounds of these organisms will be studied for several therapeutically and industrially significant biological activities, including anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antiviral and anticoagulant activities by applying a wide variety of screening tools, as well as for ion channel/receptor modulation and plant growth regulation. Chromatographic isolation of bioactive compounds will be followed by structural determination. Sustainable cultivation methods for promising organisms, and biotechnological processes for selected compounds will be developed, as well as biosensors for monitoring the target compounds. The work will entail sustainable organic synthesis of selected active compounds and new derivatives, and development of selected hits to lead compounds. The project will expand marine compound libraries. MAREX innovations will be targeted for industrial product development in order to improve the growth and productivity of European marine biotechnology. MAREX aims at a better understanding of environmentally conscious sourcing of marine biotechnology products and increased public awareness of marine biodiversity and potential. Finally, MAREX is expected to offer novel marine-based lead compounds for European industries and strengthen their product portfolios related to pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, cosmetic, agrochemical, food processing, material and biosensor applications.
100|grant.3785635|246987; 95941; MARBIOTEC*EU-CN*|European-Chinese Research Staff Exchange Cluster on Marine Biotechnology|European-Chinese Research Staff Exchange Cluster on Marine Biotechnology|Marine biotechnology is one of the most exciting emerging fields of technology. It becomes more and more important in many areas of application such as the production of new drugs, food ingredients, agrochemicals, and cosmetics. More recently, it was found that some products of marine organisms are also of extreme importance in the rapidly growing field of nano(bio)technology, another technology of the future. These developments have been recognized by the European Commission as well as by national funding organizations in Europe and in China, which included marine biotechnology and nano(bio)technology in their priority research programmes. Both the European Research Area (ERA) and China as one of the main players in the Asian-Pacific Research Area (APRA) are in the worldwide lead in marine biotechnology and nano(bio)technology regarding to the number of publications and patent applications. However, different sectors of these technologies are differently developed in Europe and China, suggesting that a combination of the complementary expertise in these sectors will be of benefit to both partners. The proposed international staff exchange programme is based on three institutions in Europe and four institutions in China (universities and research organizations including marine stations) with a number of top-ranked research groups in the field of marine biotechnology, drug discovery/natural products chemistry, biomineralization and material sciences / nanotechnology. The objective of the project is to create an efficient and successful programme for the transfer of knowledge between the partners by the exchange and training of staff (both early-stage researchers and experienced researchers) of the participating institutions. The goal is a lasting integration of the research capacities in the European Union and China in the multidisciplinary field of marine biotechnology/nano(bio)technology.

This was due to the search of innovative design solutions specifically tailored for facing with the problem of transportation engineering where the vehicle requires high stiffness, low weight, low noise, low cost design. The project will allow the co-operation among five different research groups of different sizes but all active at international scale, in the automotive, aerospace, naval, and railway transportation. The process of exchanging researchers and coordinating activities will allow maximising the specific expertise of each group, and aiming also to a faster selection and developments of the candidate panels, configuration and materials. In fact, the range of such panels is now very large according also to the possibility offered by new technologies, but these last are still to be deeply investigated in order to explore their capabilities. Further, on the researcher shelf there are innovative methods that only a decade ago were at an initial stage; in fact, the increase of the knowledge about standard predictive structural and structural-acoustic tools has been impressive and in the near future some of the methods now used at research level will enter in the common engineering practice. In this project they will be extensively used, tested and verified against the specific measurements that will be needed to verify the predicted and expected performances. Several candidate solutions will be suggested and motivated at the beginning of the project, so defining a sort of current design. The results will qualify how and where the specific performances have been increased without penalties for any other standard requirements. The main attention will be devoted to assure compliance with the static requirements and to improve the dynamic and vibroacoustic performances. Other emerging requirements as the flammability will be also investigated.
100|grant.2777544|BB/H005692/1|Control of G-quadruplex self-assembly through glycosidic bond angle|Control of G-quadruplex self-assembly through glycosidic bond angle|In our planet nature has evolved for millions of years adapting and evolving. Whilst doing that it created and utilized codes to do so. So far as we can ascertain DNA sequence is the code for life as we see it. Currently various groups make use of this understanding of how nature uses its molecules to perform functions to develop highly organized nano-size materials, motors, and other tools with various functions both inside and outside cells. DNA is one of these molecules. The double-helical structure of DNA is not the only structure that it adopts. There is a particular architecture DNA folds into that looks more like a knot- it is known as G-quadruplex structure. DNA can thus also fold into many different forms of this architecture. Many of these knots are unexpectedly resistant to high temperatures and to degradation by exposure to enzymes. These properties, together with our understanding of other highly fine-tuned properties derived from evolution, make DNA a molecule that can be utilized for technological purposes. However, in order to realize their potential, we have to understand how to use them for design purposes. In this context, a fundamental question is what type of knots/forms can DNA adopt and how do we control their formation? We know that one of the four bases that make up DNA is mostly responsible for adoption of these knots; G. Sequential segments of Gs make up the knots. The G can be locked into two different positions. Utilizing this understanding we have previously established that there are 26 theoretically possible knots. Better yet, we have predicted that the context of the presence of the two states of G in the DNA molecule will control the precise knot DNA folds into. In this project our aim is to verify experimentally our prediction that it is possible to utilize the two states of G in the DNA sequence to control the folding of the 26 knots. Indeed, it is also currently known that the folding into these knots can be influenced by very small chemical modification of this G base. We will also systematically measure some of the properties that make these knots of interest as materials and tools. We will measure both their temperature stability and their resistance to enzymes. Lack of good performance in these two domains is usually the cause for not using molecules from cells for technological purposes. Our proposal is thus fundamental to the future use of DNA knots for technological purposes. There are two significant benefits of the proposed work. Firstly, we hope to establish that it is experimentally feasible to design these knots. This is important for making nanomaterials and biotechnological tools. Secondly, data generated from this work has the potential to predict knots formation from the DNA sequence. This is relevant since it allows for developing a method for finding these knots in the genome. Currently, this is of great interest since these knots happen to have controlling functions in the genome. Thus the association of type of knot with function will be made feasible.  Technical Summary In order to realize programmed build up of DNA objects, devices, and materials, a systematization of the principles at the basis of control of the construction process is necessary. Much progress has been made in self-assembly of complementary (Watson-Crick) DNA. Here we propose establishing the rules for a rational approach towards the design of quadruplex topologies. Utilizing the formalism of quadruplex folding, based on a two-state disposition of the glycosidic bond angle, we have derived the sequence of stacking tetrad GBA combinations feasible for anti-parallel quadruplexes of three loops. In order to provide proof of concept validating this axiomatic approach we experimentally determined one of the hypothesized topologies. The control of the fold of this representative novel topology of three-stacked tetrads containing all three loop types was exerted through the length of the loops bridging the quadruplex stem. A single sequence was tried to achieve this topology. However, not all topologies can be discriminated through their loop length alone. Several issues may impede successful design; e.g. loop composition and its interactions may influence the topology, or the assembly of quadruplex entities may result in multistranded architectures, or both 5' and 3' ends may have to be modified to stabilize single folds. More often than not, the sum of these factors in tandem determines the final topology. To minimize these effects it is currently feasible to control the fold of quadruplexes by forcing the GBA of selected guanosines of the quadruplex stem to adopt the desired conformation. Therefore, knowledge of the sequence of GBA that a quadruplex stem is able to adopt will, in principle, enable the rational design of quadruplex topologies. NMR spectroscopy is the most appropriate technique to perform this study, since it allows for the rigorous assessment of the self-assembled topologies.

Cultural diversities and Education in Science|A number of findings from research in science education are well known and broadly accepted. They refer e.g. to inquiry based, learning by doing, social dimension of learning, active learning, diversity of learning styles, based on individual, cultural, ethnic, gender-related factors. For researchers working side by side with school teachers, it is everyday experience to see how difficult it is to receive indications coming from research and transform them into teaching practice: there are cultural barriers, preparation barriers, time and resource constraints. TRACES will promote transformative research activities and investigate the factors that contribute to the research-practice gap and identify innovative policies in science education that can contribute to fill that gap. It will do so through both desk and field research, in a cyclic process of analysis, action, reflection. In particular, we are interested in looking at the effectiveness of research based science teaching in taking account of learners’ diversities in terms on individual, cultural, ethnic, linguistic, gender-related factors.

We are especially interested in the role played by bacterial adhesins (e.g. mucus binding proteins) and enzymes (e.g. carbohydrate–active enzymes, CAZymes) from major gut symbionts. Our project aims to define the nature and specificity of the interaction and characterize bacterial effectors and mucus receptors (e.g. mucin glycans) at the molecular and structural level. The experimental approaches include functional and comparative genomics, transciptomics, metabolomics, complemented by detailed molecular enzymology and structural studies of bacterial adhesins and CAZymes. Another aspect of our core-research is to define what constitutes a functional mucus layer and how it influences/is influenced by the host mucosal immune system and the microbiota. Here we rely on the use of specific mouse models (with alterations in immune and epithelium cells, microbiota composition) and the development of ex vivo intestinal cell models to assess the impact of bacteria interaction to mucus on the host, using histoimmunochemistry, confocal microscopy, gene expression studies and complemented by glycomics approach to analyse changes in mucin structure and function.

The step forward with respect to the classical field of aerial robotics is to realize aerial vehicles able to accomplish a large variety of applications, such as inspection of buildings and large infrastructures, sample picking, aerial remote manipulation, etc.The starting point is an aerial platform whose aeromechanical configuration allows the vehicle to interact with the environment in a non-destructive way and to hover close to operating points. Rotary-wing aerial vehicles with shrouded propellers represent the basic airframes which will be then equipped with appropriate robotic end-effectors and sensors in order to transform the aerial platform into an aerial service robot, a system able to fly and to achieve robotic tasks. Advanced automatic control algorithms will be conceived to govern the aerial platform which will be remotely supervised by the operator with the use of haptic devices. Particular emphasis will be given to develop advanced human-in-the-loop and autonomous navigation control strategies relying upon a cooperative and adaptive interaction between the on-board automatic control and the remote operator. Force and visual feedback strategies will be investigated in order to transform the aerial platform in a flying hand suitable for aerial manipulation.The consortium is composed of four academic groups and an SME with the role of end-user and evaluator of the project outcomes. Prototypes of aerial service robots will be developed and tested on experimental setups which will be constructed in order to reproduce typical industrial scenarios for which aerial inspection robotics can be beneficial (docking, cleaning, inspection and repairing of infrastructures, payload lifting, etc.).

In spite of high volcanic hazard the Italian 2011 census (www.istat.it) estimates that over 1.5 million of people are currently living within the caldera and its surroundings, making the volcanic risk of the area extremely high (Orsi et al., 2004). The understanding of present unrest episodes, the definition of the present state of the magmatic system feeding active volcanoes, requires the knowledge of past pre-eruptive magmatic processes and of the relationships between them and the eruptive dynamics. For these reasons the volcanological history as well as and the geochemical and isotopic characteristic of the erupted product has been a matter of extensive scientific studies. The purpose of our project is to extend the present knowledge on the evolution of the CF magma sources, its feeding system as well as the volcanological evolution as it relates to the characterization of distinct magma batches, their source(s), evolution and interaction in this evolving magma system. By combining new geochemical (major-, trace elements) and isotopic (radiogenic 87Sr/86Sr and stable delta18O) data on separated minerals and whole rocks we aim to detect processes that precede and characterize the arrival of fresh magma batches from depth. As a second goal, we will use Ba and Sr diffusion modeling in sanidines and plagioclase phenocrysts to constrain the residence times of crystals prior to erution of (a) many small scattered and isolated eruptions within the Campi Flegrei and the shift to (b) large catastrophic caldera-forming eruptions such as the Campanian Ignimbrite and Neapolitan Yellow Tuff.
100|grant.3787436|248552; 94217; euRobotics|European Robotics Coordination Action|European Robotics Coordination Action|Over the last few years successful coordination activities have been undertaken within the academic and industrial roboticscommunities (EURON and EUROP), but both communities still struggle with overcoming some remaining gaps: thecommunity-internal gaps of confusion about terminology, suboptimally coordinated transfer of research visions, technologyand people, and the limited coordinated communication with both the general public and professional audiences. Thisincludes the popular science media, European Commission, national funding bodies, and representatives from neighbouringtechnology and market domains, such as cognitive science, mechatronics, automotive, aerospace, security, computer vision,embedded control systems.This project s ambition is to create sustainable solutions to all of the above-mentioned gaps, following a policy of targetedstimulation of relevant grass-roots initiatives that both communities have already experimented with during the last couple ofyears, but that have previously seen little success because of a lack of committed, professional and coordinated support. Thedriver behind these stimulations will always be the robotics industry (since its needs for innovation and strong positioning inthe worldwide robotics market are greatest), but the academic research community will be heavily involved via a system offlexible, targeted expert contributions whose short-term benefits are easy to identify and communicate.The following activities are planned: improved industry-academia cooperation by giving more structure to commonlyorganised events (administration, annual meetings, web portal on Robotics in Europe, advanced training, roadmapping,and entrepreneurship advocacy) and by coordinated communication to the general public (press releases, visibility at majorrobotics events worldwide, robotics competitions related to the shared research and development roadmap, layman sexplanation of robotics technology in combination with semantic search support on the web portal).

Retina angiogenesis is affected: the network of arteries and veins is altered, and these are weaker and leaky, resulting in the production of exudate that frequently lead to retina detachment and blindeness. Recent studies have identified the most frequent gene and the protein causative of FEVR: the Frizzled4 gene (Fz4) that codes for a receptor protein normally expressed on the surface of retinal cells. This receptor is activated by the extracellular ligand protein Norrin and turns on an intracellular signalling pathway crucial for correct angiogenesis. A frequent and severe Fz4 mutation that results in the disease is dominant (Fz4-FEVR). The mutated protein has a different aminoacidic sequence at the carboxyterminus, it is not transported from the endoplasmic reticulum where is generated to the plasma membrane, and traps wild-type Fz4 intracellularly. Our preliminary results show that Fz4-FEVR has lost a sequence motif at the carboxyterminus to bind a protein complex, and that this complex plays a role in the transport between ER and Golgi complex of proteins bearing such motif. However, this finding does not explain yet why Fz4-FEVR is prevented to reach the plasma membrane: in other cases, the loss of the motif slowes down but does not block transport. This project has three main targets: to decipher the molecular mechanism by which Fz4-FEVR does not reach the cell surface, to generate cellular and animal models of this form of FEVR and to explore therapeutic strategies.The results of this project might have a general relevance because other genetic diseases are probably associated to mutated membrane proteins that have lost the carboxyterminal motif as Fz4-FEVR.
100|grant.5151329|GGP09012|PREP1 GENE FUNCTION IN TYPE 2 DIABETES|PREP1 GENE FUNCTION IN TYPE 2 DIABETES|Important information has been gathered over the past years concerning the identity of genes responsible for type 2 diabetes (T2D) susceptibility. These studies already proved to be helpful in uncovering novel biological mechanisms amenable to therapeutic manipulation, in guiding better drug use in certain forms of diabetes and also evidenced that many more risk genes remain to be identified. The work proposed in the present application aims at testing the significance to T2D of a previously unrecognized gene, termed PREP1, whose function in controlling glucose metabolism has recently been discovered in my laboratory. Based on this work, we already know that PREP1 gene function is increased in T2D individuals and in their euglycemic offspring, and that this defect causes insulin-resistance in muscle cells in vitro. Consistently, mice with reduced Prep1 function feature enhanced sensitivity to insulin and protection from diabetes. Using well characterized study groups (available for this work), we will now clarify whether the increased function of PREP1 associates to specific T2D features such as the impaired insulin secretion and action. We will then analyze PREP1 gene variants to determine the causes of the increased PREP1 function observed in T2D. In a different arm of the study, we will generate genetically modified mouse models featuring increased PREP1 function either systemically or in skeletal muscle, a major target of insulin action. These models, in combination with in vitro experiments, will be instrumental to understand, at the mechanistic level, how PREP1 excess impairs the insulin regulatory function on glucose metabolism, and whether this is the consequence of PREP1 activity on insulin production in addition to that on insulin action. This work may identify PREP1 as a novel T2D risk gene and uncover new potential pharmacological targets for T2D treatment.

Due to climate changes and to the increase in international trade and tourism the threats posed by mosquitoes are increasingly affecting large parts of Europe, causing understandable concerns among the populations of many Member States. Control methods, mainly based on insecticide usage, are struggling to cope with the challenges posed by the biology and ecology of mosquito vectors. INFRAVEC aims at bridging the gap between the recent advances in transgenic technology and its implementation as a novel powerful approach for vector control. To this aim, a large European Infrastructure will be established, in which the coordination of efforts, expertise and facilities provided by the individual research groups and institutions will bolster and considerably expand the overall research capabilities of the research community. INFRAVEC will operate, through a number of Networking, Joint Research, Transnational and Service activities, towards the objective of considerably strengthening research capability in Europe by sharing knowledge, resources and technology. INFRAVEC will mainly focus on Anopheles gambiae, the major vector of malaria, and Aedes albopictus, a viral disease vector that is rapidly spreading through Europe. Four Infrastructure facilities will be integrated in the project: 1) the Genetically Modified mosquito laboratory of Imperial College London; 2) the Mosquito Mass-rearing facility at the Centro Agricoltura ed Ambiente (with the support of the International Atomic Energy Agency); 3) the Bioinformatics facility at EMBLEBI, UK; and 4) the Mosquito Confined Release facility at ISRIM. INFRAVEC will provide a formidable research capability to external users and facilitate the performance of five research projects aimed at utilizing basic knowledge of mosquito genetics and biology in an unprecedented effort to develop novel opportunities for mosquito control.

This concept will be superior, intellectual property (IP) protected, and enable a much wider spread of know-how and education of this skill-intensive technology. Key functional enabling units are new production-scale, mass-manufactured microstructured reactors as well as other integrated process intensification (PI) reactors realising integrated processes. This will lead to a substantial reduction in costs, resources & energy and notably improves the eco-efficiency. To ensure the competitiveness of European (EU) manufacturing businesses, PI technology / know-how is transferred from leaders to countries (and respective medium & small industries) with no exposure in PI so far, but with a track record in sustainability, and to the explorative markets food and biofuels. A deeply rooted base will be created for IP rights (Copyright, © = COPIRIDE) by generic modular reactor & plant design and new generic processes via ‘Novel Process Windows’, facilitating patent filing. Due to the entire modular plant concept comprising all utilities – far beyond the reaction & processual parts - a holistic PI concept is provided, covering the whole development cycle with, e.g., safety & process control & plant approval. Features, inter alia, are fast plant start-up and shut-down for multipurpose functionality (flexibility in products), sustainable & safe production, and fast transfer from lab to production & business (time-to-market). Industrial demonstration activities up to production scale with five field trials present a good cross-section of reactions relevant to the EU chemical industry. The economic impact in COPIRIDE is 10 Mio €/a (cautiously optimistic) to 30 Mio €/a (optimistic) by direct exploitation. Indirect exploitation might sum up to 800 Mio €/a (very optimistic) by other companies via technology transfer.

The disease attacks peculiar muscles and patients are not able to close their eyes, blow their chicks, lift their arms and, eventually, may become wheelchair dependent. The disease has been associated to the reduction of a string of DNA elements, named D4Z4, that is located at the tip of chromosome 4 long arm. When the string of DNA is too short the disease appears. Molecular analysis allows counting the repeat number and is used for FSHD diagnosis. However, the disease can appear with different degree of severity and it is not clear how many individuals carrying the short string of DNA elements will develop the disease. Here we propose a study that analyze the Italian population of FSHD families with the intent of identifying factors that can influence the disease appearance. We expect this study will provide tools to predict the risk of developing a severe form of the disease. We also aim to identify factors that can help to prevent the disease worsening.This study will also consider patients showing FSHD clinical features without having the molecular defect with the aim of identifyig molecular markers useful for diagnosis. Finally, all clinical and molecular data will be collected in the National Registry of FSHD. The Registry will be available for distributing information to patients and clinicians and will be the basic frame of the FSHD netwok.

By today, such criteria do not exist since aircraft noise engineering has historically focused on achieving ever lower noise levels for individual events and at close distance from the runway. Within the frame of a unique approach, COSMA will - improve the understanding of noise annoyance effects due to aircraft in the airport surrounding community through field studies and dedicated psychometric testing - use these findings in setting up optimised aircraft noise shapes - develop techniques for a realistic synthesis aircraft noise around airports - validate the optimised aircraft noise shapes and their associated engineering guidelines - put in place an efficient knowledge management for design practices and scientific information on aircraft exterior noise annoyance effects Through this comprehensive workplan, COSMA will ensure optimum exploitation of the scientific research results by reducing noise annoyance at source (whether by technological or operational means) through an improved understanding of the effects of aircraft noise in the airport surrounding community. Under the technical guidance of industry experts, COSMA will integrate contributions from research organisations and SME’s, bringing together the multi-disciplinary background that is required for achieving the project objectives. COSMA is involving 21 partners from 9 different countries: Germany, France, UK, Netherlands, Sweden, Italy, Belgium, Portugal and Hungary.

Transcription factors and epigenetic modulators translate chromatin-embedded information in a dynamic and cell/gene context specific manner to orchestrate homeostasis, growth and differentiation. To date, the most powerful and commonly used approach is immunoprecipitation of chemically cross-linked chromatin (XChIP) coupled with single gene or global analysis using DNA tiling arrays (ChIP-chip) or parallel single molecule sequencing (ChIP-seq). At present, serious limitations of the XChIP technology preclude factor-DNA interaction studies at dynamic ranges below minutes. Moreover, conventional XChIP cannot be used to study samples of <106 cells or cell populations within complex biological samples. Based on established proof-of-principle experiments, the multidisciplinary ATLAS consortium will develop novel types of femtosecond (fs) UV tunable lasers to induce highly efficient DNA-protein crosslinking for ChIP analyses with unprecedented precision and reproducibility, and extending the present dynamic time range by order of magnitudes. ATLAS will further validate LaserChIP (LChIP) technologies and integrate them e.g. with manipulation of irradiated (frozen) tissues slices and microfluidic cell sorting systems. Combining LChIP with proximity ligation approaches will facilitate the analyses of cell-selective (epi)genetic programs on small pre-defined cell populations down to the single cell level. Integration of innovative SMEs with physicists, oncologists, biologists, chemists and mathematicians secures efficient introduction and application of LChIP in basic and translational research. This consortium has the technical and commercial expertise as well as the capacities to successfully develop and commercialize laser-based ChIP technologies.

Albeit our worldwide scientific excellence in the fields of research we are involved, we need new expertise in the fields of: i) biotechnology for the identification of genes involved in the biosynthesis of bioactive compounds and ii) quantum-mechanical calculations (ab-initio methods) for the investigation of the interactions occurring between organic molecules (drug candidates) and biological targets containing metals. NatPharma will address these aims by means of i) two-way secondment of staff researchers, ii) recruitment of expert researchers, iii) participation at workshops and courses, iv) organization of seminars. These actions will be integrated by the upgrading of the research equipment. Moreover, the twinning with other EU-based institutes, and the promotional activities planned will also foster a better integration of NeaNat at the European level, and will therefore foster the participation of our group in European excellence networks."""
100|grant.3771960|222690; 90530; MYCORED|Novel integrated strategies for worldwide mycotoxin reduction  in the food and feed chains|Novel integrated strategies for worldwide mycotoxin reduction  in the food and feed chains|MYCORED aims at developing strategic solutions to reduce contamination by mycotoxins of major concern in economically important food and feed chains. The following toxins and commodities are especially considered in the project: aflatoxins, trichothecenes, zearalenone, fumonisins in wheat/maize food and feed chains; ochratoxin A in the grape-wine and wheat chains; and aflatoxins in the dried fruit chain. Novel methodologies, efficient handling procedures and information, dissemination and educational strategies are considered in a context of multidisciplinary integration of know-how and technology to reduce mycotoxins exposure worldwide. Five work-packages (WPs) will develop novel solution driven strategies to reduce both pre-and post-harvest contamination in feed and food chains. They involve: i) optimization of plant resistance and fungicide use; ii) biocontrol to reduce toxigenic fungi in cropping systems, iii) predictive modelling and optimise logistics; iv) novel post-harvest and storage practices and v) application of new food processing technologies. Two horizontal WPs will develop enabling methodologies for i) advanced diagnostics and quantitative detection of toxigenic fungi and ii) rapid and multi-toxin detection of mycotoxins and relevant biomarkers. The project will significantly build on the outcome of several European projects (through most coordinators/partners of FP5 and FP6) on mycotoxins by supporting, stimulating and facilitating education and cooperation with countries having major mycotoxin concerns related to (international) trade and human health. The direct involvement of ICPC countries (Argentina, Egypt, Russia, South Africa, Turkey) and international organizations (CIMMYT,IITA) together with strong alliances with major research institutions in the USA (3 USDA Centers/5 Universities), Australia, Malaysia will strengthen the project through sharing experiences and resources from several past/ongoing mycotoxin projects in a global context.
100|grant.2764158|G0800261|Role of thyroid hormone receptors in osteoclast differentiation and function|Role of thyroid hormone receptors in osteoclast differentiation and function|Osteoporosis is a major health priority affecting half of women and one in five men over 50 and costing the NHS #1.7 billion a year. Thyrotoxicosis is an established cause of osteoporotic fracture but the underlying mechanism of bone loss has not been determined. Our recent studies, however, indicate that thyroid hormone receptor alpha (TRalpha) has a critical role in skeletal development, acquisition and maintenance of adult bone and thyrotoxic bone loss. Moreover, our studies suggest that TRalpha has an important role in regulating the activity of bone resorbing osteoclasts. Although the mechanism is unknown these studies identify TRalpha as a potential new drug target for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis. Importantly, the therapeutic potential of TR-isofom specific compounds has already been demonstrated in patients with for high cholesterol. In the proposed studies Dr Bassett and Professor Williams at the MRC Clinical Sciences Centre, Imperial College London, will characterise the actions of T3 in osteoclasts and their subsequent effects on bone structure and strength. These studies are critical and timely as it is essential that the molecular mechanism of thyrotoxic bone loss is defined, before new drugs, acting on TRalpha are developed for the treatment of osteoporosis.  Technical Summary Aims: Thyrotoxicosis is an established cause of osteoporosis and fracture but the mechanism of thyrotoxic bone loss is controversial as it is unclear whether thyroid hormone (T3) excess or TSH deficiency mediates bone loss. Although T3 receptors (TRs) and the TSH receptor (TSHR) are expressed in bone cells, our recent studies of TR and TSHR deficiency have directly addressed this controversy and established that the actions of TRs predominate. Furthermore, the skeletal phenotypes of TR deficient mice are characterised by abnormal osteoclastic bone resorption.  I hypothesis that accelerated bone loss in hyperthyroidism is mediated by the direct actions of thyroid hormone (T3) in osteoclasts.  Objectives: To address this hypothesis, I will: 1) Determine if T3 acts directly via TRs expressed in osteoclasts. 2) Determine the mechanism of T3-action in osteoclasts.  Experimental Design and Methodology: The skeletal effects of TR deficiency restricted to the osteoclast-lineage will be determined in mice using cre-lox technology. Skeletal development in juveniles and bone structure in adult mice will be determined by light, confocal and back-scattered electron scanning electron microscopy. Bone strength will be determined by destructive three-point bending and compression studies. The molecular mechanism of T3-induced bone loss will be determined using gene expression profiling and quantitative RT-PCR analysis in primary cultures of wild type and TR-deficient osteoclasts. The role of TRs in osteoblastic regulation of osteoclast differentiation will be investigated in co-cultures of wild-type and TR-deficient calvarial osteoblasts and splenic osteoclast progenitor cells.   Scientific Opportunities: The project arises from our finding that TRalpha deficiency results in increased bone mass and reduced osteoclast activity, whereas TRbeta deficiency causes osteoporosis secondary to increased osteoclastic bone resorption. Although hyperthyroidism increases bone loss, the mechanisms are unclear and reports of TR expression and T3 responsiveness in osteoclasts are conflicting. It is now essential to demonstrate whether T3 regulates osteoclast activity directly.  Medical Opportunities: Osteoporotic fractures cost the NHS #1.7 billion each year. Our preliminary data identify TRalpha as a potential drug target for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. These studies will determine the mechanism of T3 action in bone and generate in vitro and in vivo models in which to evaluate the pharmacological manipulation of TRs.

A 23-strong Consortium of the key actors in Europe’s seismic engineering research (including 3 industrial partners) addresses these problems in a sustainable way via a 4-year programme of activities at an annual cost to the Commission less than 1.35% of the total present value (€190m) of the RIs’ material resources. The scope covers all aspects of seismic engineering testing, from eight Reaction Wall Pseudodynamic (PsD) facilities and ten Shake Table labs, to EU’s unique Tester of Bearings or Isolators, its two major Centrifuges and an instrumented Site for wave propagation studies.  Transnational Access is offered to a portfolio of world class RIs: EU’s largest PsD facility, four diverse Shake Tables and the two Centrifuges.  Networking sets up a public distributed database of past, present and future test results, installs distributed testing capabilities at all PsD labs, fostering development of up-and-coming ones at Europe’s most seismic regions, drafts and applies protocols for qualification of RIs and engages the entire European community of earthquake engineering via the best possible instances: the European Association of Earthquake Engineering, EU’s seismic code makers and their national groups, the European Construction Industry, as well as all relevant S/T associations or networks.  Joint research engages all labs, exploring and prototyping novel actuators (combination of electro-dynamic and hydraulic ones) for better control of fast tests or special applications, new sensing and instrumentation systems, data assimilation in equipment-specimen models for better test control and optimisation of testing campaigns, as well as experimental studies of soil-structure interaction at all types of testing facilities.

The work focuses on the design of high lift devices. DeSiReH addresses the following quantified objectives which will make a significant contribution to meeting Vision 2020 goals:  1) Reduction of industrial A/C development costs by 5% by reduced and more efficient Wind Tunnel Testing 2) Decrease time-to-market by 5% by improved aerodynamic design turn-around time 3) Improve industrial High-Lift design process efficiency by 15% 4) Reduce A/C drag by 5% by enabling NLF though compatible High-Lift-Design  To accomplish these objectives the project is planned for a period of 4 years and a budget of 7.6 Mio. Euro. The consortium consists of 6 industry partner, 7 research establishments, 3 universities, 2 small and medium-sized enterprise and the European Transonic Wind tunnel (ETW).   Existing and validated high-fidelity numerical tools are composed to an efficient High-Lift design and optimization process chain in WP1. The strategies and tools developed are applied in WP 2 to the aerodynamic design of a high lift system for the future pointing HARLS wing (High Aspect Ratio Low Sweep) with the constraint to maintain Natural Lamiar Flow at cruise to the best possible extend. WP 3 focuses on the improvement of the experimental measurement technique for cryogenic testing. The objectives here are to enhance the measurement accuracy of the results and to generate the capability to apply different important techniques (e.g. transition measurement & deformation measurement). These techniques are finally applied in the ETW at High-Reynolds-Numbers on the HARLS model equipped with the High-Lift-System, designed in WP2.   The final assessment of DeSiReH results is done in WP4 by assessing the numerical

These materials exhibit complex dynamics and rheology and, in many cases, show hierarchical relaxation over many different timescales.  This in turn affects the processing and properties of the final materials.  In order to rationally design appropriate materials and processes for various technological applications, a rigorous, knowledge based approach is needed. This is especially urgent in the face of current opportunities offered by tailored molecular engineering of polymers at the industrial scale, and the proposed use of these materials in nano-structured composites for smart applications in devices, electronics ad high-performance applications.  The training objective of the proposed action is to provide young post-doctoral researchers with the necessary interdisciplinary knowledge and experience in the field of soft materials properties, much needed throughout Europe, which will allow them to address some of the many scientific and technological challenges in the field.  This will first and foremost be achieved through a collaborative research program and portfolio of training courses intimately linking industry and academia. To ensure fruitful collaborations, the participating research groups will work around a limited number of model systems; exchange the samples, and apply to them the techniques and/ or theoretical approaches developed in the different laboratories. The research groups are selected in order to obtain the needed synergy, as they have different backgrounds/expertise, in physics, chemical engineering, chemistry and materials science. 6 Very high profile international visiting scientists, bringing their uniques expertise to Europe, will participate in the training and research.

It has already been shown that nutritional modulation of lipid homeostasis via direct supplementation, e.g., n-3 fatty acids, or via indirect mechanisms, e.g., dietary polyphenols, has beneficial effects on human health. There is growing evidence that ether phospholipids such as plasmalogens play a central role in mediating the beneficial effects, but the underlying mechanisms are not understood.   ETHERPATHS will develop systems biology tools that will facilitate studies of dietary interventions aiming to modulate lipid homeostasis. Specifically, we will develop (1) models that enable studies of gut microbiota and its effect on host cell metabolism, (2) dynamic models of systemic lipid metabolism, and (3) pathway reconstruction methods to study tissue-specific effects of dietary interventions. All models will be optimized in the context of studies of dietary interventions and will be integrated into a sophisticated software platform. In silico strategies will be complemented by multiple experimental approaches, including (1) dietary interventions involving n-3 fatty acids and polyphenols, combined with tracer studies in vitro and in vivo (2) in vitro colon model (3) in vivo germ-free and conventional models of altered lipid metabolism, specifically of plasmalogen deficiency.  ETHERPATHS includes academic and industrial partners with combined unique expertise in information technology, bioinformatics, metabolic and physiological modelling, systems engineering, biochemistry, microbiology, lipid metabolism, metabolomics, obesity and metabolic syndrome, and clinical nutrition. We expect the ETHERPATHS tools to be broadly applied in nutrition research, and anticipate that the novel findings generated within the project will be applied for development of new food products for better health.

Complementary, hybrid propulsion technology, as defined in ORPHEE (Operational Research Project on Hybrid Engine in Europe), appears as a new generation of advanced space transportation system. Engines based on this innovative propulsion concept provide advantages like thrust performance, throttling (thrust modulation), versatility (easy adaptation to various configurations), simplicity, safety. which significantly reduce the global engine cost. It will help to consolidate the long term sustainability and ensure a technology needed by the European propulsion space community to remain independent.  Hybrid propulsion principle is based on the injection of a liquid oxidizer into the engine combustion chamber where it reacts with a solid fuel to generate hot gases providing the thrust. Enlarge the burning surface is the current proposed solution to reach the needed performance level. It dramatically increases the solid grain volume and the engine weight, limiting the applications. The regression rate is a key parameter controlling the solid fuel grain design. Its increase is a very attractive solution to reduce the grain volume.   The main objectives of ORPHEE are to increase versatility of space propulsion system, ensure significant increase performance of hybrid engine, improve solid fuel technological maturity from TRL 1 to 3 and gather European skills on hybrid propulsion and ensure European access to space  In near future, the availability of new hybrid engines will allow the access to new space transportation missions and to obtain significant costs reduction. It will consolidate the knowledge on this innovative technology, allowing the European space community to become non dependant. It may be considered as a competitive propulsion solution to be implemented in future space agencies roadmaps.
100|grant.3773484|231143; 90429; ECHORD|European Clearing House for Open Robotics Development|European Clearing House for Open Robotics Development|The European robotics industry plays a key role in maintaining our continent's industrial base. The robotics industry is strong, but fragmented and dispersed. In the future, cutting-edge technology resulting from top-level research will be the decisive factor for success. Europe not only has a powerful robotics industry, but can also boast superb research. By drawing on these resources, ECHORD aims at producing new knowledge through advancing the state of the art in selected research foci and developing novel technology from which new products can be derived. Within ECHORD, opportunities for knowledge advancement and technology transfer between academia and industry will be created across the whole continent. This will be achieved through the solicitation of focused, small-size RTD projects, so-called experiments, which can be rapidly negotiated, funded and executed. Via these experiments, ECHORD will bring about a large-scale introduction of robotic equipment into research institutions. This is expected to result in both tangible and measurable out-comes in terms of the accelerated development of technologies, as well as the deployment of robotics technology into new scenarios for the direct application of research results. For ECHORD, three such scenarios have been defined: human-robot co-working, hyper flexible cells, and cognitive factories. The foremost purpose of the scenarios is to define an environment that is both scientifically challenging to research institutions and commercially relevant to robot manufacturers.

The EVINCI-study is a prospective clinical European multicenter trial performed in a cohort of 700 patients with suspected IHD. Patients with intermediate pre-test probability will undergo clinical and biohumoral characterization, including novel circulating markers of cardiovascular risk. They will be admitted to a non-invasive cardiac evaluation, consisting of “anatomic” imaging, by multislice computerized tomography, combined with “functional” tests among radionuclide, magnetic resonance and ultrasound imaging. Heart catheterization will be performed to validate non-invasive diagnosis and follow-up to assess outcome. The diagnostic accuracy of combined non-invasive “anatomo-functional” imaging will be tested against reference methods for diagnosing epicardial coronary lesions (coronary angiography), vessel wall atherosclerosis (intracoronary ultrasound) and impaired coronary flow reserve (intracoronary doppler/pressure wire). The individual profiles from “anatomo-functional” cardiac imaging and “clinical-biohumoral” data will be combined and tested against outcome. A cost-benefit analysis (including an estimate of procedural/radiological risks) of the new diagnostic work-up will also be performed. A relevant part of the EVINCI-study will be dedicated to the development, in cooperation with the industry, of an advanced informatics’ platform able to synthetically present to the end-user (patients, physicians, etc.) the integrated cardiological diagnostic profile of the individual patient as resulting from clinical-biohumoral and multi-imaging assessment. Overall results will be disseminated in cooperation with the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and will guide the work of a dedicated ESC Commission which will release specific European Recommendations.

This is normally because the abstract was not required at the time of proposal submission, but may be because it included sensitive information such as personal details.  Technical Summary There are two distinct parts to this project:  1. Development of an antibody-based vaccine This proposal is based on a mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb) AP33, developed in-house, that is capable of neutralizing infection by all hepatitis C virus (HCV) major genotypes and subtypes. As AP33 is a broadly neutralizing antibody recognizing a highly conserved epitope in the HCV E2 glycoprotein, this region is a target for vaccine development. Attempts using appropriate antigen fragments were not successful in eliciting antibodies against this protective epitope, indicating that designing immunogens displaying the correct presentation of the epitope will be essential for generating the desired response. To this end, we will use innovative approaches to generate such antigens and immunize animals with them. We will test whether these immunogens are capable of eliciting appropriate immune responses in immunized animals, and whether the immune sera are able to neutralize virus infection in cell culture assays.  2. Identification and development of novel antibodies with therapeutic potential We have generated a large repertoire (approximately 1200) of mouse hybridoma lines that secrete MAbs to plasma membrane proteins of human liver origin, with the objective of using them as a means to identify putative cellular receptor(s) for HCV entry into target cells. Recent advances in cell culture infection models provide an excellent opportunity to screen this bank of anti-liver membrane MAbs for the ability to inhibit virus infection. Any inhibitory MAbs identified thus will be humanized and evaluated for their therapeutic potential. Innovative approaches will be developed to overcome possible deleterious effects that antibodies directed against a cellular target may have on the host.   Both parts of this project are founded on extensive experience of MAb development. Arvind Patel's group has ample experience of raising mono- and polyclonal antibodies to numerous viral and cellular antigens. We have developed ELISA-based assays for screening and characterizing appropriate antibodies, and pilot immunizations have already yielded promising results. Crucially, we have also generated a novel reporter cell line that will allow high throughput screening for antibodies that inhibit infection by HCV bearing envelope glycoproteins of any genotype.
100|grant.3777047|218819; 89683; GRASP|Green Advanced Space Propulsion|Green Advanced Space Propulsion|Space activities and applications play an important role in strengthening the competitiveness of Europe by scientific progress in the knowledge-based society, and by providing strategic influence and security. Major successful space missions under European leadership have placed ESA and its Member States, the European science community at the forefront. To continue this path Europe must have independent and competitive access to space. With the ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) continuing to impede the acquisition of US components, Europe thus needs to develop an assured independent source of propulsion components.  Today space craft propulsion relies heavily on toxic and carcinogenic hydrazines as propellants. Hydrazine itself is widely used as monopropellant and MMH and UDMH is used as bipropellant fuel. These propellants are a threat to people and the environment, and handling these toxic propellants impedes costly safety measurers.   As new ideas and new technologies emerged in the last years, and as the concerns about both the environment and the handling of carcinogenic propellants significantly increase, the so-called Green Propellants show potential improvements with respect to performance and cost. The goal of this project is thus to select the most promising green liquid propellant candidate/s and to push the propulsion technology to the level needed to prove that Green Propellant technology is feasible and competitive. Research and development on Green Propellants and adjacent propulsion technology in Europe is geographically fragmented and insufficiently funded. With the present consortium, some of the key-players in Europe will harmonize their capabilities to meet this demanding goal.

The respective research teams will be enforced by two newly recruited experienced researchers offering complementary expertise to the consortium.  The proposed development of biomimetic glue products (an adhesive that employs man-made materials to mimic the efficient attachment mechanisms of marine organisms) will revolutionise the field of adhesive and surface technology. Although the competence in the EU seems to be high in terms of marine expertise, the available new knowledge needs to be transferred to the industry and implemented for the development of marketable products. The objective of Blue4Glue is to transfer and build up new knowledge in three research topics, in which bioadhesion plays a central role in each of them:   (I) Development of bio-inspired systems for the modification of surfaces to achieve dirt release effects   (II) Development of polyolefin based adhesive release films (III) Development of a concept of under water bio-adhesion for bio-inspired synthetic material    Procter & Gamble wishes to set up a transfer of knowledge with two academic partners: the University of Naples (UNINA) and the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Technology and Applied Materials (FRAUNHOFER). Both partners will help P&G understand the mechanical, chemical and physical characteristics of adhesion and implement bio-inspired materials in future consumer products.

Heterozygous IP females can survive owing to X-inactivation mosaicism and present neonatal rush, and frequently malformations of eyes, teeth and central nervous system. NEMO, whose mutations are causative of IP, encodes a crucial regulatory protein responsible for NF-kB activation, a transcription factor of universal importance being involved in many cellular functions including immune response, cell survival and neuronal plasticity. NEMO is the point of convergence for many NF-kB inducers. IP pathogenesis is due to mutations that impair every functional domain of this protein. Loss-of-function mutations of NEMO account for 60% of IP patients. Mutations of NEMO that only reduce its function cause IP in heterozygous females and Ectodermal Dysplasia associated with immunological defects (EDA-ID) in hemizygous males. The genetic defect has only been identified in 70% of the IP patients. Thus, the frequency of NEMO mutations is underestimated, and/or the contribution of other genes still remains to be established.The overall objective of this proposal is to contribute in ameliorate our understanding of the genetic and pathological aspects of NF-kB related diseases paying a special attention to reveal all the molecular interactions involving NEMO protein that are affected in IP, in particular in the Central Nervous System. The elucidation not only of the NEMO mutations but also of the functional consequences of such mutations causing IP will help to establish the exact mechanism of the disease and to devise the new treatments that will change patient life.

100|grant.3774734|213855; 89913; ACCENT|Adaptive Control of Manufacturing Processes for a New Generation of Jet Engine Components|Adaptive Control of Manufacturing Processes for a New Generation of Jet Engine Components|ACCENT addresses the relevance to the call 7.1: “Aeronautics and Air Transport” by “Improving Cost efficiency” and quality of safety critical aircraft engine components. The manufacture of safety critical rotating components in modern aero engines is by nature very conservative. In order to achieve the required engine performance, thermal and mechanical stresses are pushed to the maximum, which in turn leaves the choice of materials to exotic super alloys. These materials are classed as difficult to machine under normal circumstances, but when added to the changes in mechanical properties which occur naturally from part to part, consequently variable and often unpredictable tool life, and the ever present possibility of random and unexpected process anomalies, machining processes can never be fully optimised. Stringent legislative controls are placed on safety critical component manufacture to ensure that parts entering service will function correctly and safely to a declared service life, and in declaring the service life for such a part, the machinability issues stated above have to be taken into consideration. Hence manufacturing process parameters are often reduced or tools are changed early to ensure part surface integrity.   The industry method adopted, is to “freeze” to process following process qualification to first article inspection, and successful part validation via laboratory examination and testing. Once frozen, no changes to process parameters are permitted without time consuming and costly re-validation.  ACCENT will allow the European Aero Engine manufacturers to improve their competitiveness by applying adaptive control techniques to the manufacture of their components. Being able to adapt the machining process to the constantly changing tool and component conditions whilst operating in a multi-dimensional “approved process window”, processes will be optimised to the prevailing conditions and no longer “frozen”.

Objective of the Green Regional Aircraft ITD is to mature, validate and demonstrate the technologies best fitting the environmental goals set for the regional aircraft entering the market in the years 2015 - 2020. The project has 5 main domains of research, in which several new technologies are under investigation in order to entirely revisit the aircraft in all of its aspects.
100|grant.3785888|211927; 94132; EXTICE|EXTreme ICing Environement|EXTreme ICing Environement|More recent aircraft incidents and accidents have highlighted the existence of icing cloud characteristics beyond the actual certification envelope defined by the JAR/FAR Appendix C, which accounts for an icing envelope characterized by water droplet diameters up to 50 μm (so-called cloud droplet). The main concern is the presence of super-cooled large droplets (SLD) such as freezing drizzle, in the range of 40-400 μm, or freezing rain, with droplet diameter beyond 400 μm. International airworthiness authorities, namely are intending to jointly develop and issue updated regulations for certification in SLD: “Appendix X”. If implemented, the proposed new rules will require aircraft manufacturers to demonstrate that their product can safely operate in SLD environments. To do so, they will be requested to demonstrate that specific capabilities comply with the new regulation. Compliance has typically involved actual flight into natural icing conditions. Since SLD icing conditions occur less frequently than the current Appendix C icing specifications, it will be difficult and expensive to demonstrate compliance by the use of natural icing flights alone. Therefore, it is expected that a greater reliance will be placed on the use of so-called engineering tools (icing tunnels, tankers & computer codes).  The objectives of this proposal are twofold. One objective is to reduce aircraft development cost by improving tools and methods for aircraft design and certification in an icing environment. On the other hand, since the proposal will address the development and validation of Means of Compliance and tools for aircraft icing certification, this research activity will also have a direct impact on aircraft safety, allowing future aircraft to be designed safer with respect to the icing and the SLD environment.

One issue with these products is their instability both on the shelf and upon digestion. Recently, gastric-stable bacterial-derived carotenoid preparations have been discovered by members of this consortium and these 2nd generation carotenoid preparations, and the bacteria that produce them will be studied. Existing prototypes will be developed as potential food additives but an extensive screen for new 2nd generation prototypes will also be made from marine environments. The consortium includes microbiologists, biochemists and food bio-technologists and will determine the identity of new carotenoid preparations and the bacteria that produce them. The nutritional value of these bacteria will be assessed and a risk-benefit assessment made using modern metabolomic technologies as well as traditional toxicology in order to designate the prototypes as QPS (ie, qualified presumption of safety). Bioprocessing of these bacterial carotenoid preparations will eliminate traditional chemical synthesis and the use of organic solvents. Also the delivery system will utilise a synergistic biological matrix making it a sustainable source. The use of these bacteria as colour-nutritional additives will be assessed by process optimisations, colour and texture analysis. The consortium includes 9 partners, including one ICPC and one associated country. Two IND partners, one an SME, will work together to exploit prototypes as additives, colourants and as functional foods. This will include patenting, licensing and the opening of new markets. Both IND partners are looking for new markets in the food additive/functional food sector and this project will enable them to identify new markets. The project will directly impact the food industry by developing new, natural as well as novel food additives and ingredients that can replace synthetic ones.
100|grant.3771255|212045; 87799; ENSURE|Enhancing resilience of communities and territories facing natural and na-tech hazards|Enhancing resilience of communities and territories facing natural and na-tech hazards|Since a long time vulnerability is a key concept in disaster literature. Nevertheless the majority of studies and grants have been allocated to hazards related research, neglecting the influence of vulnerability of exposed systems on the death toll and losses in case of natural or man made disasters. There is the need to better identify and measure also the ability of menaced and affected communities and territorial systems to respond. This is the starting point of the ENSURE project. The overall objective of ENSURE is to structure vulnerability assessment model(s) in a way that different aspects of physical, systemic, social and economic vulnerability will be integrated as much as possible in a coherent framework. The ENSURE approach starts from the recognition that for all considered hazards most of damages and most of vulnerabilities arise from the territory, including artefacts, infrastructures and facilities. They may well represent its material skeleton: physical vulnerability is therefore entirely “contained” at a territorial level. Other vulnerabilities, such as systemic, economic and social have interactions with the territory, but cannot be entirely determined at a territorial level. The project will start by assessing the state of the art in different fields related to various vulnerability aspects as they have been tackled until today in Europe and internationally. The core of the project consists in integrated models comprising already existing models to assess vulnerability and develop new ones for those aspects that have been neglected until now. The research objective is therefore to achieve progress with respect to each individual sector of vulnerability and to enhance the capability of assessing interconnections among them in a dynamic way, identifying driving forces of vulnerability, that make communities change for the good or for the worse as far as their ability to cope with extreme events is concerned.

Its objectives are to enhance excellence in this field, to address and improve the technological level and competitiveness of turbomachinery design products and their operation as part of propulsion systems and energy conversion processes. EUROTURBO 8, is the eighth in a series of bi-annual conferences started for the first time in 1995 in Erlangen (Germany). This conference will be of primary interest to researchers, design engineers, users of turbomachinery components and to students being trained in presentation and discussion of their first scientific results. The conference is intended to be a primary driver for technology transfer across Europe in this field through the presentation of the latest developments and best practices. It is also intended to enhance cross-fertilization between the aeronautical field, found in the edge of turbomachinery technology today and all other fields using turbomachines. The conference is also seen as an integrating element between the Western and Eastern European countries and as an additional mean to foster collaboration in turbomachinery research at a European level. Finally, this conference is seen as an ideal forum to relate and disseminate the results of research projects funded by the European Commission. Therefore, support for this conference of about 22 % of the total budget is requested from the Commission.
100|grant.3774963|201678; 86767; EUCLYD|A European Consortium for Lysosomal Disorders|A European Consortium for Lysosomal Disorders|The EUCLYD consortium aims at developing a scientific network among outstanding communities of basic and clinical investigators in five European countries (Italy, Netherlands, UK, Sweden and Germany) to study various aspects of lysosomal storage diseases (LSD). LSDs are rare disorders (overall prevalence of 1/5000 to 1/8000), each due to a specific lysosomal enzyme deficiency, leading to intracellular storage of a variety of undegraded substrates (sphingolipids, glycosaminoglycans, glycoproteins and glycogen) in different tissues. Among the 40 to 50 LSDs presently known, EUCLYD will focus on Gaucher disease, Pompe disease, MPS VI and Multiple sulfatase deficiency, as prototypes of disorders with different stored materials in various organs and tissues outside the CNS. The issues to be investigated in the proposed project are: pathophysiology and mechanisms underlying the symptoms and leading to devastating clinical consequences; natural history; testing of novel therapeutic approaches. These issues will be addressed by patients studies and with mouse models recapitulating the phenotype of LSDs.  Recent advances in the pathophysiology of LSDs point to the role of secondary processes triggered by substrate storage. A better understanding of these processes is crucial to identify new targets of therapy. Enzyme replacement and substrate reduction therapies were successfully introduced in the treatment of specific LSDs. However, pilot clinical trials should be supported by post-marketing studies to further assess the efficacy of these therapies and to develop standardized treatment protocols. To this purpose a precise knowledge of the natural history of LSDs is essential. Novel therapeutic strategies, such as enzyme enhancement and gene therapy are still under investigation in cell systems and in animal models. EUCLYD will provide further testing of these approaches in order to translate state of the art knowledge into clinical applications and reach patient's bedside.

The concept has been proven viable through the Enabling Grids for E-sciencE project (EGEE and EGEE-II, 2004-2008) and its related projects. EGEE-II is consolidating the operations and middleware of this Grid for use by a wide range of scientific communities, such as astrophysics, computational chemistry, earth and life sciences, fusion and particle physics. Strong quality assurance, training and outreach programmes contribute to the success of this production Grid infrastructure. Built on the pan-European network GÉANT2, EGEE has become a unique and powerful resource for European science, allowing researchers in all regions to collaborate on common challenges. Worldwide collaborations have extended its reach to the benefit of European science.The proposed EGEE-III project has two clear objectives that are essential for European research infrastructures: to expand, optimize and simplify the use of  Europe's largest production Grid by continuous operation of the infrastructure, support for more user communities, and addition of further computational and data resources; to prepare the migration of the existing Grid from a project-based model to a sustainable federated infrastructure based on National Grid Initiatives. By strengthening interoperable, open source middleware, EGEE-III will actively contribute to Grid standards, and work closely with businesses to ensure commercial uptake of the Grid, which is a key to sustainability. Federating its partners on a national or regional basis, EGEE-III will have a structuring effect on the European Research Area. In particular, EGEE-III will ensure that the European Grid does not fragment into incompatible infrastructures of varying maturity. EGEE-III will provide a world class, coherent and reliable European Grid, ensuring Europe remains at the forefront of scientific excellence.
100|grant.3777467|201662; 86765; TUMIC|An integrated concept of tumor metastasis: implications for therapy|An integrated concept of tumor metastasis: implications for therapy|From many perspectives our concept of the process of metastasis is inadequate and needs to be revised. In particular, the potential impact of recent ideas about the cellular basis of tumor growth (cancer stem cells) and the establishment by remote tumors of special permissive microenvironments in target organs prior to metastasis (metastatic niches) remains to be explored. In the TuMIC project we will use novel experimental approaches to integrate these newly emerging principles and ideas with the different hypotheses that have until now tried to explain the process of metastasis. Specifically we aim to understand how cancer stem cells behave in and contribute to metastasis, and how networks and pathways that are known to regulate metastasis affect their properties. Further objects are to determine how a permissive microenvironment for metastasis formation is established in given organs, how this contributes to determining patterns of metatasis, and how these microenvironments interact with cancer stem cells. These studies will facilitate the development of an improved and more accurate concept about the process of metastasis. In turn, this will have fundamental ramifications for the way in which novel anti-cancer therapies are designed, and most importantly should provide important new insights into how cancer and in particular metastatic disease can be successfully treated. With this in mind we will also perform preclinical studies that build on TuMIC findings with the aim of developing novel anti-cancer therapies.

The disease attacks peculiar muscles and patients are not able to close their eyes, blow their chicks, lift their arms and, eventually, may become wheelchair dependent. The disease has been associated to the reduction of a string of DNA elements, named D4Z4, that is located at the tip of chromosome 4 long arm. When the string of DNA is too short the disease appears. Molecular analysis allows counting the repeat number and is used for FSHD diagnosis. However, the disease can appear with different degree of severity and it is not clear how many individuals carrying the short string of DNA elements will develop the disease. Here we propose a study that will analyze the Italian population of FSHD families with the intent of identifying factors that can influence the disease appearance. In addition, the results of this study will provide tools to predict the risk of developing a severe form of the disease. We also expect to identify factors that can help to prevent the disease worsening.This study will also consider patients showing FSHD clinical features without having the molecular defect with the aim of identifyig molecular markers useful for diagnosis.Finally, collection of all clinical and molecular data will lay the basis for the creation of the National Registry of FSHD. The Registry will be available for distributing information to patients and clinicians and will be the basic frame of he FSHD netwok.

The current state-of-the-art in research into European identity has been driven almost exclusively by a 'top down' elitist perspective that focuses upon the development of an identification with 'Europe' through centrally-driven policies. The Euroidentities project will use advanced methods of qualitative biographical interviewing and analysis to gain insights into the evolution and meanings of a European identity or identities from the 'bottom up' perspective of the individual. This will include investigating the factors that promote or retard a positive identification with 'Europe' and the Community. The project's research strategy will be to target five special 'sensitized groups' -- aggregates whose life experience will have caused them to confront questions of their own identity within Europe.  The five groups broadly conceived are: 'transnational workers' at all levels from menial economic migrants to 'high end' technological workers;  mature adults who experienced cross-border educational exchange schemes earlier in their lives; farmers wo are subject to Europe-wide markets and systems of regulation; 'cultural contact' workers; participants in civil society organisations.  The seven partner teams in Euroidenties include large and small nations who are in both orignal and accession states located both in the peripheries and the core of Europe. Euroidentities will employ a focused dissemination strategy that will include from the outset interaction with policy makers and others in public arenas at national and European levels.

The emphasis is on manipulation capabilities achieved by dexterous and autonomous, and also human aware dual-arm/hand robotic systems. The goal is to allow a dual-arm robot including two multi-fingered redundant hands to grasp and manipulate the same objects used by human beings. The objects shall be allowed to have different shape, dimension and weight. The manipulation will take place in an unsupervised, robust and dependable manner so as to allow the robot to safely cooperate with humans for the execution of given tasks. The robotic system has to possess the ability to autonomously decide between different manipulation options. It has to properly and quickly react to unexpected situations and events as well as understand changes in the behaviour of humans cooperating with it. Moreover, in order to act in a changing scenario, the robot should be able to acquire knowledge by learning new action sequences so as to create a consistent and comprehensive manipulation knowledge base through an actual reasoning process. The possibility to exploit the high power-to-weight ratio of smart materials and structures will be explored aimed at the design of new hand components (finger, thumb, wrist) and sensors that will pave the way for the next generation of dexterous robotic hands.

This infrastructure consists in interfacing three types of platforms: (i)The in situ Long Term Experimental Plateforms which consists in developing experiments for the main type of land use systems (arable crops, grasslands, forest, marchlands, heathlands…), where different types of land management are imposed for a long term and where the state variables of the system are monitored for long term in conjunction with the measurement of the environmental fluxes to atmosphere and hydrosphere. (ii)The in vitro ECOTRON equipments where blocks of ecosystems of different size could be introduced within controlled environment. Since feedbacks between the plants and the soil responses take time to establish, experiments often need to last a few years. An alternative use of Ecotrons is to analyse the physiology of blocks of ecosystems which have been subjected in situ for years to various treatments within LTEP platforms. In that case, Ecotrons can be seen as ecological analysers receiving samples for analysis. (iii) The in silico Data base and Modelling platform should complete the system by developing facilities for sharing data bases among European scientific community, and possibilities for coupling experimental with theoretical approaches. This Design Study aims at developing and sharing this ANAEE concept among European research partners in order to (i) specify the needs for such “instrument” for the scientific stakes on continental biosphere; (ii) convince national strategic research institutions to support such a concept; (iii) inventory the capacities of partners to develop such a network of equipments; and (iv) determine the condition for networking and sharing these infrastructures among different European countries.

Different studies have identified PPAR-gamma coactivator-1 (PGC-1alpha) as a relevant type 2 diabetes susceptibility gene playing an important role in human obesity as well. Subsequent investigations led to the discovery that p160MBP (MybBindingProtein) serves as a PGC-1alpha inhibitor. More recently, we showed that p160MBP is controlled by the Prep1 gene. Prep1 hypomorphic mice feature increase sensitivity to insulin due to raised PGC-1 alpha and decreased p160MBP levels. These mice also exhibit decreased fat body mass. Indeed, we also identified Prep1 in genetic screenings in C. Elegans and mouse ,as a major gene involved in energy homeostasis and obesity. Importantly, we have preliminary data showing Prep1 overexpression in euglycemic first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetics, which are at very high risk of diabetes. This project aims at understanding how Prep1 gene controls insulin sensitivity and determines adipogenesis, obesity and type 2 diabetes in humans. We will: 1: elucidate the molecular basis of Prep1 role in insulin sensitivity and adipogenesis through in vitro and animal model studies; 2: assess the significance of Prep1 function to insulin sensitivity in humans and the role of this gene in type 2 diabetes and its subphenotypes and in other components of the metabolic syndrome; 3: identify Prep1 target genes and establish their potential as targets for novel strategies to treat type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. To achieve these objectives we have built a multidisciplinary network and gathered experts in the Prep1/p160MBP signaling, type 2 diabetes and obesity molecular biology and genetics, human and mouse genetics and high throughput analysis of gene expression and identification of target genes.

It shows that the performance and operational flexibility of systems are enhanced  by exploiting the spectral efficiency of filter banks and the independence of sub-channels. Combining with offset quadrature amplitude modulation (OQAM), no cyclic prefix is needed, all the radiated power is used and gains in maximum throughput compared to OFDM are achieved. Robustness to Doppler and jammers is obtained and new functionalities are possible. The high resolution spectrum analysis capability is exploited for DASM and cognitive radio and a single device can do spectrum sensing and reception simultaneously.Research in signal processing is carried out to complete the knowledge in filter banks for transmission and satisfy  requirements of new radio systems: fast initialization, optimum transmit-receive processing for single and multiple antenna (MIMO) systems, scalability. Research in communications concerns dynamic access and cross-layer aspects, and compatibility with OFDM. In cognitive radio, research deals with radio scene analysis and channel identification and the impact of the independence of sub-channels on transmit power control and dynamic spectrum management. A simulation software is developed for a typical WiMAX configuration and scenario and performance comparison with OFDM is carried out. A real time soft/hardware demonstrator is built to complete simulation results and show efficient architectures.The expected impact of PHYDYAS is the migration of wireless systems to a physical layer that is more efficient and better responds to the needs of dynamic access and cognitive radio. The consortium consists of leading academic research groups across Europe, teamed with world leading companies in infrastructures, circuit design and instrumentation.

Most epilepsies do not recognize a specific triggering mechanism or an hereditary transmission; however, a small fraction (1-2%) of epilepsies are genetically-determined. Within these hereditary forms, Benign Familial Neonatal Convulsions (BFNC) have a typical onset in the first week of postnatal life and end spontaneously by the age of three-six months. The genetic basis of most hereditary forms of epilepsies, including BFNC, have been identified, leading to the concept that a altered function of ion channels (membrane proteins controlling the flux of specific classes of ions across the plasmamembrane of neurons and other excitable cells) can lead to the neuronal hyperexcitability underlying epilepsy. Therefore, a pressing current interest is the understanding of how such genetic alterations disturb the electrical activity of the brain, and how such altered excitability triggers the convulsive phenotype. The present research project, which will be carried out by an established multidisciplinary team of clinical and basic researchers, aims to solve some crucial issues in the epilepsy field. The achievement of the proposed aims, by furthering our understanding of the intimate molecular mechanisms of operation and of the functional role of a specific class of ion channels, will improve knowledge about the pathogenesis of BFNC, and will lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches in epileptic patients, 25% of whom do not receive satisfactorily treatment.
100|grant.2757957|PP/E003346/1|Proposal for UK participation in Phase II of the International Muon Ionisation Cooling Experiment|Proposal for UK participation in Phase II of the International Muon Ionisation Cooling Experiment|One of the most challenging questions in understanding the origin of the Universe is why it is almost entirely made of matter. We believe the Big Bang which created it made equal amounts of matter and antimatter. It is possible that the answer to this puzzle lies in the properties of particles known as neutrinos. We know very little about neutrinos. They are fundamental particles; they weigh almost nothing and they hardly interact with ordinary matter. It is possible that neutrinos and their 'antiparticles' (antineutrinos) behave differently -- a phenomenon known to physicists as 'CP violation'. Because they interact are so weakly, intense beams of neutrinos are needed to study their properties. Machines called 'Neutrino Factories' promise intense neutrino beams The neutrinos would come from the decay of parent particles called muons. These would be stored in a special ring -- the 'decay ring' -- and allowed to decay naturally to neutrinos. Beams of neutrinos would then travel several thousands of kilometres to large detectors where their interactions would be studied. Muons beams can be produced quite easily, but they are large and have a wide spread in angle. A fundamental challenge in the design of a neutrino factory is to reduce the size of the muon beam so that it can fit into the decay ring. The process of reducing the size and spread of a beam of particles is known as 'cooling'. There are a number of commonly used ways of cooling beams of particles but these take a long time and cannot be used for muons because they decay to neutrinos in a few microseconds. The development of a new technique called 'ionisation cooling' is essential. If a beam of muons is passed through some material the muons will slow down. If they are then all reaccelerated in the same direction, the size and spread of the beam will be reduced. If this process is repeated many times, the beam can be made narrow and parallel enough to fit into a storage ring. The Muon Ionisation Cooling Experiment (MICE) at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the UK aims to demonstrate the ionisation cooling of muons for the first time. It consists of a short 'cooling section' which contains 'absorbers' where the muons lose energy and 'cavities' where the muons are accelerated by high electric fields. The muons will be guided by strong magnetic fields from superconducting magnets. The size the muon beam will be measured before and after it has passed through the cooling section. Because the cooling section is short the cooling effect will be quite small and the before- and-after measurements must be made with a precision of one part in a thousand. The high electric and magnetic fields, and the possibility that liquid hydrogen will be used as an absorber material, mean that the engineering of MICE is extremely challenging.

This deficiency results in the accumulation of partially degraded molecules in the cells of affected patients and this, in turns, by unclear reasons, leads to the clinical manifestations. Affected patients are, in fact, characterized by organs alterations associated to aggressive behaviour and, as main clinical sign, mental retardation resulting from a severe central nervous system impairment. So far, the bases of this neuronal impairment, i.e. the pathogenesis of the disease, are not well understood, nor efficient therapies are available. The proposed project aims to use the available MPS IIIB murine model both for pathogenesis and therapeutic studies. For the first item, the project will get a better knowledge of the molecular bases of the disease by analysing the differencesin gene expression in tissues from the central nervous system of affected mice compared to normal controls, and by studying the intracellular effects of these alterations. For the therapeutic studies, the project aims to evaluate the ability of intracranial injections of viral particles modified to be safe and to provide the lacking enzyme, to correct the brain pathology.

100|grant.2756523|EP/F008023/1|Quantum Measurements with Photons|Quantum Measurements with Photons|Measuring the length of an Olympic swimming pool doesn't affect how much water it has in it! We normally don't expect measuring things to change them. In the quantum world, things are very different.Quantum mechanics tells us how the world works at its most fundamental level. It predicts very strange behaviour that can typically only be observed when things are very cold and very small. It has an inbuilt element of chance, allows superpositions of two different states, and includes super-strong correlations between objects that would be nonsensical in our everyday world - entanglement . Despite this strange behaviour, quantum mechanics is the most successful theory that we have ever had - it predicts what will happen almost perfectly! However, it is not completely understood, and some of its implications are still being discovered.One of the great mysteries of quantum mechanics - The Measurement Problem - seeks to answer the question Why don't we see superpositions in the everyday world? ( alive and dead for example). Measurements play a special role in quantum mechanics and have been the subject of intense debate since the theory's development early last century. Recently quantum measurements have emerged to become an important practical issue. This is the result of the advent of quantum information science , which seeks to answer the question What advantage can be gained by specifically harnessing quantum mechanical effects in the storing, transmitting and processing of information? Anticipated future technologies include quantum computers with tremendous computational power, quantum metrology which promises the most precise measurements possible, and quantum cryptography which is already being used in commercial communication systems, and offers perfect security.Unlike measuring the length of a pool, measuring a quantum system necessarily disturbs the system. For example a standard measurement of a system in a superposition of two states finds the system in one of those states with some probability. After the measurement, the system is no longer in a superposition, but is in the state it was measured to be in with certainty. The original superposition state can never be recovered, and that information is lost.More general quantum measurements involve a payoff between the information gained and the disturbance of the system. Quantum mechanics also allows entangling measurements on two or more systems, that leave them in an entangle state. Finally, we can intentionally manipulate the system being measured depending on what the measurement tells us - feedback.These general quantum measurements could play an important role in future quantum technologies: the security of quantum cryptography relies on detecting an eavesdropper by the disturbance their measurements must cause; quantum metrology requires entangled measurements; and some schemes for quantum computation proceed via measurements alone.Single particles of light - photons - are excellent system for developing new quantum measurements, because they suffer from almost no noise. They also have great potential for application in future quantum technologies: schemes for all optical quantum computers are leading contenders, and photons are the obvious choice for both quantum communication and for quantum metrology schemes for measuring optical path lengths. This project will realise new quantum measurements which are entangled, tuneable in the amount of disturbance, and include feedback. It will use an optical crystal to produce up to six photons, optical circuits to realise controlled interactions between them (with feedback), and standard avalanche photodiodes to detect them. A particular focus will be on developing practical schemes for efficiently extracting information from quantum measurements. Finally, the project will design and implement techniques for distinguishing between quantum processes on up to 4 photons.

Obesity is particularly closely linked to the development of diabetes, with its attendant risks of blindness, kidney failure and amputation. These diseases are becoming more common. They both result from a combination of lifestyle factors and genetic susceptibility. Now that we are beginning to make strides in understanding the nature of these genetic and lifestyle factors, we need to better understand exactly how they interact to result in disease. When we do so, we will be in a much better position to target our attempts at prevention and treatment in the right way to the right individuals.   This application comes from a group of scientists, some based in basic science laboratories, some working with patients, yet others working in the area of public health. We want to bring our individual skills and knowledge together to create a Centre for research in obesity and diabetes that is greater than the sum of its parts. Through charitable and other sources we have already raised #20M for a new building in Cambridge to act as the hub for this Centre and are now looking to the MRC to help us to provide the core research facilities (including equipment and specialised technical staff) required for our studies. The MRC funding would also enable us to increase the number of students we train in this important but relatively neglected area.  Technical Summary Obesity is a major threat to public health in the UK and internationally. The clearest impact of obesity on health is through its influence on insulin resistance,diabetes and dyslipidaemia. Improved understanding of the fundamental causes of obesity and how it impacts on insuln resistance, diabetes and vascular risk will be critically important to the design of effective strategies for treatment and prevention.   We propose the establishment of a new MRC Centre for Translational Research in Obesity and Related Metabolic Disease (MRC CTROM) which exploits the existing collaborative interactions between internationally renowned clinical and basic scientists at the University of Cambridge, relevant MRC Units within the Cambridge area, the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and Oxford University. We believe that the collective expertise and reputation of this group of investigators will provide a unique intellectual synergy with the capability of becoming a world-leading centre for translational research in this crucially important area of biomedical research.
100|grant.3778700|35561; 82427; S2S|Sound to sense|Sound to sense|The aim of this RTN is to elucidate the interaction of knowledge and sensation in speech perception, by developing a psychological/computational model of speech recognition that reflects the flexible response to the availability of information in the sign al that is comparable to that of humans listening to their native language (L1). A central focus is to track how phonetic information, especially fine phonetic detail that varies systematically with linguistic/interactional structure and function, is used under different circumstances: when the listener has appropriate linguistic-phonetic knowledge (listening to L1), possibly inappropriate or inadequate knowledge (listening to a foreign language (L2)), and inadequate access to the signal (listening in adverse conditions). A related focus is to elucidate how phonetic information contributes to understanding: modelling will reflect known attributes of auditory processing, and linguistic and statistical properties of language units. The ultimate aim is to provide models of speech perception that closely reflect the flexibility and robustness of human speech recognition, that pave the way for the next generation of robust automatic speech recognition and text-to-speech machines, and promise to offer a new theoretical basis for L2 teaching and for diagnosis and treatment of speech disorders. Cross-disciplinary training is essential to achieve these aims: no single discipline or pair of disciplines currently teaches all the information and skills required to achieve them, many work independently of the others, and some assume old models that have been superseded in other disciplines. By nurturing a sufficiently large group of scientists who will lead a sustained, cross-disciplinary effort to understand human speech processing, we hope to provide the basis for more integrated work and faster progress in speech understanding in the future.

This will allow assessment of the role of the tissue microenvironment on modulation of mutation risk and on persistence of radiation-induced mutants in the kidney.  Molecular analysis will determine the mechanisms leading to proton-induced Aprt mutants in exposed kidneys or in kidney cells irradiated in culture.  It is predicted that proton exposure will result in mutants that lose the Aprt gene and other genes that are located in nearby regions of mouse chromosome 8.  Studies are proposed to test if protracted exposure lessens the frequency of proton-induced mutants while also lowering the risk of killing kidney epithelial cells.  The toxic and mutagenic effects of sequential exposure to protons and iron ions will be assessed (with iron ions serving as a representative heavy ion in the GCR) to test whether the risks are additive.  Results from these studies will help reduce uncertainties in estimating the risk of cancer for astronauts exposed to protons alone or in mixed radiation fields.  They will also provide detailed knowledge of the types of mutations that are created by these exposures that can contribute to the development of cancer.  New studies are included to address the links between centrosome abnormalities, aneuploidy and mutagenesis as a function of dose, LET, and tissue microenvironment. This research will have a direct impact on our understanding of proton-induced toxicity and mutations in a mammalian epithelial tissue. This has relevance to cancer therapy involving proton exposures that not only target malignant tissue, but which also involve limited exposure of normal tissues that can develop late complications as a result of proton exposure.  In addition, our in vivo/in vitro approach also illuminates the importance of the normal tissue environment on the modulation of radiation sequelae. A new focus of work in the final year of funding was the establishment of the dose response for cell killing for 240 MeV/amu Si ions, to begin to address portions of the supplemental aims.  Experiments were performed in triplicate with kidney epithelial cells irradiated in vitro in the Fall 2011 NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) run.  The results indicate substantial cell killing, with Si ions nearly equal to Fe ions in their potency when the data are considered in terms of absorbed dose.  Si ions were much more toxic to kidney epithelial cells in culture (per unit dose) than 1 GeV protons.    Studies were also initiated to develop populations of cells in which to measure centrosome abnormalities and aneuploidy at the earliest times post-irradiation also in order to assess portions of the supplemental aims.  Replicate cultures were exposed to graded doses of Fe ions and processed for future use. In addition, clonal isolates were developed of non-selected and Aprt mutants after exposure to low to moderate doses of Fe ions and were processed for future use. These studies were performed during the Spring and Fall 2011 NSRL runs.  Similar studies were initiated in the Fall 2011 NSRL run for kidney clones derived from in situ exposures to graded doses of Fe ions.  We have continued with the molecular analysis of changes in Aprt mutant and non-mutant clones following exposures to lower doses of Fe ions.  Characteristic Fe ion-induced alterations initially identified in mutants arising after a high dose exposure can be readily detected at lower doses.  Genome-wide analyses indicate that these characteristic events may involve other non-selected chromosomes and that they can also be found in subsets of Fe ion-induced mutants arising after lower dose exposures.

To this end, we will engineer stable synthetic oscillator networks in yeast and mammalian systems able to express mRNA/protein levels with a pre-determined frequency and amplitude.  The synthetic oscillator network has to guarantee stable and synchronized oscillation in the cell population. The yeast system will be used as a test-bed for the synthetic biology design strategies developed in this project. In the context of the mammalian tissue, individual cellular oscillators have to be synchronized in order to fulfill the macroscopic function of an insulin delivery device. Hence, the engineering of the synthetic network involves additional inputs and outputs that enable resetting of the oscillators.  In view of therapeutic application, the desirable system would reset insulin oscillations synchronously with the circadian rhythm. Specifically, the synthetic oscillator in the mammalian system will be connected to circadian signals like PER1 and CRY. To achieve this aim, COBIOS brings together scientists from yeast and mammalian molecular biology, computer science, engineering and control theory. We will employ methods from systems dynamics and control theory to develop and implement modular control networks that enable oscillations in the networks they will be connected to.  In particular, we will address the problems of - robustness of controller dynamics, - suitable interfaces to the controlled networks, and - mechanisms for regulation of the controller's dynamic characteristics (e.g. period and amplitude) through external signals that can be exogeneous (yeast system) or outputs of cellular signal processing (the circadian clock in mammalian system) at the levels of individual cells and tissues.

NoE seeks to establish durable integration of leading research institutions, industrial partners and SMES working in complementary fields of detections and methods for food quality and safety. MONIQA aims at overcoming European and worldwide fragmentation in food quality and safety (Q and S) research by integrating key organisations in a core consortium. Benefits through dissemination and joint research will also be available to associated partners (=associates). The core consortium (=partners / members) seek to establish mechanisms for coordinating and finally merging research activities, personnel and infrastructure. The industry and SME sector will benefit through application of the harmonised detection method and technologies, as will the consumers of high quality and safe food. The core consortium comprises a network of 30 members. The geographic diversity covers 11 EU member states (19 partners), 2 Associated Candidate Countries (3 partners), 2 Associated countries (2 partners), 1 MPC country (1 partner) and 4 Asian/Oceanic countries (5 partners). From the 30 members, 12 are research institutions, 11 are centres of higher education (HE), 2 are industry partners and 5 are other organisations (NGO, small companies). Seven SMES are full partners in the consortium. Ten of the partners have a female leader (about 30%). A total of 174 researchers and doctoral students are planned for integration into the network with more than 40% of female researchers and more than 55% of female PhD students. Using the calculation provided in the Guideline, this results in a calculated Grant for Integration of 2,840,000 per year or 14,200,000 for a duration of 5 years.

CD affects as much as 1% of the Europeans (2.5 million people) and is the most common food intolerance in Europe. If recognised, CD patients have only limited access to safe foods and there is no causal therapy available.  The general objective of this STREP is to significantly reduce the number of people suffering from CD in Europe, by developing primary prevention strategies for CD. By European collaboration of leaders from disciplines beyond those traditionally used, a.o. from academia, patient organisations and industry, we will carry out innovative research to examine the hypothesis that it is possible to induce tolerance for gluten in genetically predisposed children through the introduction of small quantities of gluten during the period of breast-feeding.  Measurable objectives are: 1) Taking full advantage of genomics techniques: Identification of the immunological mechanisms involved in initiating the aberrant response to gluten introduction in the diet of infants genetically predisposed to CD; 2) Identification of the factors in the early dietary history involved in the aberrant response to gluten in children; 3) Development of new European guidelines for early nutrition in order to prevent CD.  To achieve our objectives we propose the following structure and methodology: I) A prospective, randomised, blind dietary intervention study in 1000 young children from high-risk families for CD, to asses the possibilities to induce immune tolerance for gluten in genetically predisposed children; II) A follow-up population study in 16.000 children aged 12 years, born during and after the Swedish epidemic of CD, to asses the late effect of dietary history, concerning gluten exposure and breast-feeding, on the development of CD and related autoimmune phenomena.
100|grant.3779176|37611; 85220; EUROPRISE|European vaccine and microbicides enterprise|European vaccine and microbicides enterprise|The successful development of preventative strategies against HIV-1 (microbicides, vaccines or their combined effects) would provide a pivotal turning point in global efforts to combat the pandemic spread of AIDS providing an incalculable impact on solving societal problems associated with this disease.  The principal aim of this proposal is to bring together EU scientists from both microbicide and vaccine fields to embrace a coordinated approach to HIV-1 prevention research. Partners in the EUROPRISE consortium represent 14 projects funded by the European Commission in the sixth Framework as well as one project funded by the Gates Foundation. These projects involve 132 institutions from 22 countries. In this respect, EUROPRISE is the first organisation, both in Europe and internationally to deliberately bring these groups together in a truly integrated fashion. EUROPRISE will promote an integrated program of research, coordinating a wide portfolio of activities encompassing the whole pipeline of vaccine and microbicide development from early discovery through to early clinical trials. This unique approach places the Network at the international forefront of understanding the interface between these two technologies, pursing a critical path to the development of effective HIV-1 prevention strategies.
100|grant.3777590|46042; 85196; ESOA|European school of Antennas|European school of Antennas|The European School of Antennas (ESoA) is a new model of geographically distributed school with the objective to reinforce the European training and research in wireless applications. ESoA feasibility has been successfully proved in the FP6 Network of Excellence 'ACE - Antenna Centre of Excellence', using a highly qualified integrated set of advanced post-graduate courses, distributed in the most accredited European research centres on antennas.  In the first year of experimentation (2005), ESoA has registered 340 graduated student and 130 speaker in its first 15 courses. The purpose of this proposal is to give a co-financial support to continue the ESoA activity in the triennium 2007 to 2009, with the implementation of 22 courses. The importance and the interest about the present general theme is confirmed by the key roles that the wireless applications play in the Information Society of Technologies, in particular for emerging communications, navigation and sensing services, aeronautics and space, transport, security.  The general objectives of the School are: - reinforcing the European excellence in the systems air interface with emphasis on antenna components; - creating an effective specialistic formative offer to complete individual PhD curricula of European students; - increasing the ties in wireless research and development between Universities and Industries on a European scale; - facilitating the interchange of ideas among early stage researchers and trainers as well as among young researchers, thus increasing the future mobility and synergy.

CD affects as much as 1% of the Europeans (2.5 million people) and is the most common food intolerance in Europe. If recognised, CD patients have only limited access to safe foods and there is no causal therapy available. The general objective of this STREP is to significantly reduce the number of people suffering from CD in Europe, by developing primary prevention strategies for CD. By European collaboration of leaders from disciplines beyond those traditionally used, a.o. from academia, patient organisations and industry, we will carry out innovative research to examine the hypothesis that it is possible to induce tolerance for gluten in genetically predisposed children through the introduction of small quantities of gluten during the period of breast-feeding. Measurable objectives are: 1) Taking full advantage of genomics techniques: Identification of the immunological mechanisms involved in initiating the aberrant response to gluten introduction in the diet of infants genetically predisposed to CD; 2) Identification of the factors in the early dietary history involved in the aberrant response to gluten in children; 3) Development of new European guidelines for early nutrition in order to prevent CD. To achieve our objectives we propose the following structure and methodology: I) A prospective, randomized, blind dietary intervention study in 1000 young children from high-risk families for CD, to asses the possibilities to induce immune tolerance for gluten in genetically predisposed children; II) A follow-up population study in 16.000 children aged 12 years, born during and after the Swedish epidemic of CD, to asses the late effect of dietary history, concerning gluten exposure and breast-feeding, on the development of CD and related autoimmune phenomena.
100|grant.3775031|37900; 85053; SIROCCO|Silencing RNAs: organisers and coordinators of complexity in eukaryotic organisms|Silencing RNAs: organisers and coordinators of complexity in eukaryotic organisms|A recently discovered layer of gene regulation in eukaryotic organisms employs small regulatory RNAs (miRNAs and siRNAs). These RNAs are 20-28 nucleotides long and are produced by Dicer ribonucleases acting on double-stranded RNA precursors. Together with an effector protein complex, they scan for complementary RNA or DNA so that expression of these targeted molecules is silenced at the transcriptional or posttranscriptional levels. These short RNAs influence gene expression during growth and development and initiate epigenetic changes to DNA and chromatin. SIROCCO will characterize the full complement of miRNAs and siRNAs in animals and plants. Using bioinformatics, genomics, biochemistry, cell biology and genetics, the sortium members will reveal how these RNAs are produced and processed, how they are transported and how they target specific genes and RNAs for silencing. SIROCCO will investigate the miRNA and siRNA profiles associated with development, with phenotypic divergence within populations, and with diseased states including cancer. The functional genomics of silencing RNAs will be addressed by up- or down-regulation of miRNA and siRNA species. There will also be an assessment of miRNA and siRNA regulatory networks and their interaction with other cellular trol mechanisms. The outputs of SIROCCO will include databases of silencing RNA sequence and function in several organisms, new technologies for detection and manipulation of these RNAs, and information that will allow siRNA and miRNA profiles to be used as molecular markers and diagnostic methods for natural biological variation including the perturbations associated with disease. SIROCCO will also identify potential targets of disease therapy amongst the components of the small RNA silencing systems. Finally, insights generated in SIROCCO will improve the specificity with which small RNAs can be employed as therapeutic tools.

The European Unions self-sufficiency and leading position in the global market for pork and pork products is challenged by Brazil, China, USA and Canada. The need for developing innovative, integrated, and sustainable food production chains of high quality pork products matching consumer demands is being addressed by the present project, Q-PORKCHAINS.  The strategy of the project is to develop and test advanced and multi-disciplinary approaches for identification, characterisation, prediction, and control of the quality of pork and pork products in different stages of the pork chain in diverse production systems.  The project will in 6 RTD modules explore development potentials of different aspects of the pork chain: consumer and citizen behaviour and preferences; on-farm production systems; product development; integration and sustainability within the pork chain; new biology for quality control; and the development of prediction models for quality, safety and anima l welfare.  Furthermore, 3 horizontal modules include activities to ensure innovation through: active participation of SMEs and larger industries in pilot research and demonstration chains; dissemination of knowledge and technology through education and training from academic to vocational level and SME networking; and professional management of the consortium and its relations.  Q-PORKCHAINS is a highly multi-disciplinary and integrated project which will apply the latest advances in genomics and biology in a quality context defined by consumer and citizen preferences and will provide research results, innovation and breakthroughs that will strengthen the competitiveness of a sustainable European pork sector.
100|grant.3766193|045254; 80484; IWARD|Intelligent robot swarm for attendance, recognition, cleaning and delivery|Intelligent robot swarm for attendance, recognition, cleaning and delivery|IWARD targets mainly hospitals and healthcare centres to overcome the shortages of healthcare staff - a major issue in European healthcare. Our aging society and economic pressure increase the patients-to-medics' ratio, having an adverse effect on healthcare quality and performance. Not being able to attend all patients at the right time and not keeping the hospitals clean enough (e.g. MRSA Transmission) also increases recovery time and cost.  To improve the quality of healthcare, these focal issues emerge: fast identification and location of patients needing immediate attention; reduction of human errors; effective cleaning in hospitals; wider reach of specialist medics, possibly attending patients remotely. To achieve this, IWARD presents a robot swarm delivering support to oversee activities in healthcare environments, providing a multipurpose, cost-effective and scalable solution to enhance quality of healthcare.  Four major tasks are: attendance, recognition, communication and support (assisting/cleaning). Attendance means to monitor hospital wards by robots acting as a dynamic swarm. Recognition points out, that the swarm is able to recognize patients or objects needing attention, providing immediate information about the location and needs of the concerned patients. The robots can be equipped with different adaptable hardware components for floor cleaning and delivery of food, linen, medicine etc. All mobile robots are capable of providing patients and visitors with guidance and information. It provides easy to use but high tech interaction interfaces like voice control through mobile and fix-mounted robots.  The swarm based approach unburdens the nursing staff from the details of robot control and central coordination - reducing the complexity of robot control to that of a chat, having the swarm negotiating which robot to use for each job, shortening the reaction time, reducing human error and increasing efficiency to deliver better patient care.
100|grant.6770889|SR/00/113|A multi-approach tool for the volcanic risk management of the Goma region (North Kivu) (GORISK)|A multi-approach tool for the volcanic risk management of the Goma region (North Kivu) (GORISK)|Context and objectives The region of Goma lies under the direct threat of volcanic hazards with the Nyiragongo and Niamulagira volcanoes that are amongst the most active in Africa. The recent eruption that occurred in January 2002 produced a spectacular lava flows that destroyed part of the city. Although the amount of casualties was limited, hundred thousands of refugees were pushed out of the area which added some more pressure in a highly politically sensitive area at the border with neighbouring Rwanda. The mitigation of the direct volcanic risks is depending on the availability of an efficient volcanic activity monitoring system. The GORISK project is oriented towards the improvement and implementation of techniques dedicated to the study and monitoring of the Nyiragongo. An important GORISK segment concerns the ground deformations monitoring that are amongst the most important parameters to monitor; it is addressed by both space borne and ground based observations. Volcanic plume fallouts are also a big concern as it causes damage to vegetation and cultivations. GORISK takes benefit from the ongoing EU project NOVAC and US-NSF project VISOR that are focused on ground based and space borne respectively monitoring of the plume. These observations are combined to additional geochemical ground measurements of water quality. In situ measurements can provide useful and sometime crucial clues. Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and radon (Rn), together with other gases, can migrate from deep reservoirs and exhale through micro seepages to the surrounding areas therefore producing significant enrichments in the atmosphere. CO2 for example can locally concentrate and become a major concern for the population. GORISK also involves the study of the possible impact on health of the volcanic activity. A Belgian NGO, the CEMUBAC is providing an epidemiological study based on data acquired in health centres for the last ~10 years, and on plume dispersion maps created from the VISOR and NOVAC projects. Methodology •	Ground-based deformation monitoring systems involve a network of 5 telemetred tiltmeters deployed on the southern flank of the volcano, in areas selected based on preliminary space borne InSAR measurements (through the SAMAAV – ESA Cat-1 3224 project). Continuous InSAR measurements are performed using ENVISAT ASAR data acquired on a regular basis. •	The project also benefits from a GPS network currently under construction installed by the Luxembourg MNHN GORISK partner. •	Geochemical measurements are made for meteoric and spring waters. These systematic measurements are intending to study the eventual fluctuations of the geochemical parameters and the modelling of the aqueous and hydrothermal systems in relation to the volcano. •	Gas measurements are made in the air, in water (springs), and in the subsurface. The simultaneous recording of various gases (e.g. CO2 , and CH4 ) together with continuous measurements of radon will be performed in the air at the surface and (deleted) in the soil. Radon is a very valuable tracer in connection with its carrier gases, it is easy to measure continuously produces very sensible responses. The analyses of micro seepage of these gases from natural gas reservoirs will be performed by exhalation measurements. •	Health data are studied by using a probabilistic approach for the plume dispersion. Health data are gathered in centres located in plume prone and free areas. •	GORISK data are integrated into a common GIS platform as a tool to be exploited by the local users (GVO, CEMUBAC, and UN-RMU) •	The sustainability of the methods is ensured by training of the GVO staff members. Results expected GORISK will strengthen the capacity of GVO to observe ground deformations. Previous works, especially the one developed under SAMAAV, has evidenced the efficiency of InSAR in detecting regional scale deformations related to the Nyiragongo eruption in 2002, Nyamulagira in 2002 and 2004. More recently, in November 2006, a large scale deformation occurred with the eruption of Nyamulagira. GORISK is expected to demonstrate that routine InSAR monitoring is providing valuable data for the study of these two active volcanoes. The telemetred ground based measurements will provide in near real time deformation information which will be combined to the other data (seismic network, geochemistry, visual observations… ). That systematic measurement will help in the understanding of the mechanisms which in turn will contribute to the mitigation of the associated risks. New field of investigation are developed for the monitoring of subsurface gas emanation; that will provide new information datasets. In particular the monitoring of the radon may provide valuable information to be interpreted with the other data. The monitoring of the environmental impact is also of a major importance as the area is under high demographic pressure and needs a real management. Much is expected from the epidemiological investigation which should be facilitated by the large available database provided by the health centres and the monitoring of the plume direction and SO2 content.

Estimates of the radiological risk of developing thyroid cancer are derived from epidemiological studies performed in populations receiving high doses. Extrapolation of this risk to exposures at much lower doses is compromised by the lack of an accurate model of the dose response curve for thyroid cancer at low doses. Moreover, such population-based estimates fail to take into account the contribution of individual genetic variability to the risk estimate. Individuals with an increased genetic predisposition to develop thyroid cancer are not identified, and it is precisely these individuals who will be at greatest risk at low doses. The GENRISK-T consortium is composed of thyroid cancer experts with experience in the fields of radiation biology, animal models of radiation-induced cancer, tumour banking, cancer biology, molecular genetics, histopathology, cytogenetics and risk modelling. We will use this interdisciplinary knowledge to define the genetic component influencing the risk of radiation-induced thyroid cancer. This will be achieved through a combination of studies using animal models and in human radiation-induced thyroid tumours. This new understanding of genetic risk modifiers will be used to develop an animal model of thyroid cancer that is responsive to low dose radiation in the cGy range, thereby providing an experimental solution to resolving the uncertainties of the low dose response curve.

The InterAct consortium will use observational and trial data to investigate these interactions and explore the implications of these discoveries for preventive action. The observational part of the project is built around a large case-control study nested within an existing multi-national cohort - the EPIC study. The cohort for this project is large, comprising 350,000 participants from 8 European countries. Standardised dietary and physical activity information is available at baseline, and there is an available DNA source and plasma for nutritional biomarkers. Follow up has been completed for an average of 8 years. The collaborators have tested the feasibility and validity of an approach to ascertaining and verifying incident cases of T2D and will amass a case set of 10,000 individuals. A control cohort free of diabetes at baseline and during follow-up is readily available. To ensure efficient and high quality data, DNA extraction and genotyping will be undertaken using centralised high throughput methods. InterAct will undertake a programme of research aimed at describing the association of dietary and nutritional factors with type 2 diabetes, and will describe the association of physical activity with future risk and the ways that these factors interact with obesity. The genetic elements of InterAct will be focused on genes for which there is biological plausibility for interaction. The choice of polymorphisms in candidate genes will be undertaken by a group leading efforts to discover diabetes genes through a variety of approaches including whole genome association studies and through connection to on-going work on nutrigenomics including the NUGO network. We will genotype all 20,000 individuals for genetic variants in 200 key genes and will analyse the data for gene-lifestyle interaction.

A large research effort is dedicated to periodic structures, also called photonic crystals (PC). These materials have a periodic variation of the refractive index on the length scale of the wavelength of visible or near-infrared light and can be structured at one dimensional (1D), two dimensional (2D), or three dimensional (3D) structures. PCs are expected to have important applications as materials for photonic devices like optical components, and light sources. Properly patterned photonic crystals may exhibit photonic bandgaps. Whereas inside a photonic bandgap optical modes are absent, at the edge of the bandgap the density of optical modes is highly increased. These bandedge states are therefore ideal for the realization of laser cavities. Lasing of bandedge states in patterned materials, both inorganic and organic, doped with laser dye was recently observed. The present proposal is focused on the exploitation of soft materials, namely polymers, liquid crystals (LC) and composites made out of them, for the realization of photonic structures to be employed both as single lasing devices or as part of innovative integrated systems. There is a clear reason for our choice between inorganic and organic materials. Soft materials exhibit very attracting optical/mechanical/chemical/thermal properties and flexible processing techniques. Combined with holographic fabrication techniques, they can be patterned quite easily into many unique structures. Therefore, the proposed activity primarily concerns the investigation of soft matter based photonic structures to realize cheap, compact (i.e. micro-sized), tuneable mirror-less laser sources operating in the visible and NIR regions of the spectrum. The most interesting aspect of these lasing systems is that optical and geometrical parameters can be modified by applying weak external fields (temperature, electric field, mechanical stress, optical field, etc.), hence resulting in a direct control of lasing features (wavelength tunability, bandwidth, emission direction). Several aspects of light transport in such materials are unknown up to know. The new physics underlying the lasing effect in these structures will be studied by custom engineering them and by performing up-to-date optical experiments. Summarising, the proposed research activity promise to have a strong impact both on fundamental aspects of the optics of complex systems and on the technology of lasing sources with many potential applications, whenever a tunable, micro-sized, compact, stable, and cheap source is needed, for instance in the telecom field, or in bio-medical applications.

While the stress in performance is shifted from sheer accuracy to more complex measures, the paramount concern becomes safety of the robot system. ""A robot may not injure a human being..."", or, to rephrase the famous quote, under no circumstances should a robot cause harm to people in its surroundings, directly nor indirectly, in regular operation nor in failures.  PHRIENDS is about developing key components of the next generation of robots, including industrial robots and assist devices, designed to share the environment and to physically interact with people. Such machines have to meet the strictest safety standards, yet also to deliver useful performance: this poses new challenges to the design of all components of the robot, including mechanics, control, planning algorithms and supervision systems. We propose an integrated approach to the co-design of robots for safe physical interaction with humans, which revolutionizes the classical design paradigm of industrial robots - rigid design for accuracy, active control for safety - into a new one: design robots that are intrinsically safe, and control them to deliver performance.  Although the scope of this STREP proposal cannot encompass the integration of complete robot systems, PHRIENDS will create and deliver new actuator concepts and prototypes, new dependable algorithms for supervision and planning, new control algorithms for handling safe human-robot physical interaction and for fault-tolerant behaviour, and will integrate these components in meaningful subsystems for quantitative evaluation and experimental testing. The project will also importantly contribute to the ongoing effort of international bodies towards the establishment of new standards for collaborative human-robot operation."

Major technical innovation is made possible by the comprehensive space-time coverage of Earth observation (EO) data and the interactive networking/connecting capabilities of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). Therefore, a key feature will be a set of EO- and ICT-assisted integrated systems and services which are the fundament for integrated water resources management of river basins, irrigation schemes, and farms. It also is the basis for technical and social learning that enables farmers to act responsibly by fine-tuning their on-farm irrigation management in accordance with the river-basin water status and management decisions.  We consider the economic, environmental, technical, social, and political dimensions and pursue a synergy of leading-edge technological innovation (that facilitates active participation) with participatory approaches (that require distributed spatial information and networking technology). A set of pilot Case Studies has been selected to represent a sample of the wide range of conditions found in the European and Southern Mediterranean and in Latin America, covering Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Morocco, Mexico, Peru, and Brazil. We will benchmark the technical, environmental, and economic performance of irrigation systems in our pilot river-basins, conduct trial campaigns with EO- and ICT-assisted products in a participatory evaluation with stakeholders, and assess the effect of the new tools on water productivity and performance of our pilot irrigation systems.

Owing to the reverberant nature of the sound field in an aircraft cabin, existing methods are categorically insufficient for this task and entirely new methods shall be developed. Two parallel approaches are pursued. In the first, the sound power entering the cabin is locally extracted from local measurements of the total field. This approach employs a hitherto unavailable microphone array concept: the double layer array, together with purpose-developed processing and procedural algorithms. In the second approach, the sound power entering the cabin is determined globally through numerical inversion of measurements throughout the entire cabin using the new experimental tools. This will be achieved with pioneering Inverse Finite Element implementations and groundbreaking Inverse Simplified Energy Methods, developed in close connection with novel measurement technology and algorithms, extended from the local to the global level. At all stages in the project, the interaction between local and global approaches and between measurement and processing is exploited to maximum innovative effect. The successful implementation of the results of these developments is ensured by a carefully designed validation campaign involving ground and flight tests in both aircraft and helicopter cabins.
100|grant.3766989|30861; 81472; MOET|More Open Electrical Technologies|More Open Electrical Technologies|In line with the vision 2020, MOET aims to establish the new industrial standard for commercial aircraft electrical system design, which will directly contribute to strengthening the competitiveness of the aeronautical industry. MOET will also contribute reducing aircraft emissions and improving operational aircraft capacity. Recent National and European research activities and state of the art commercial aircraft developments, have launched more advanced approaches for on-board energy power management systems. These benefits have also been recognised in North America where this is being given special consideration. A step change is necessary to remove current air and hydraulic engine off-takes and further increase the electrical power generation capability.  This in itself will require significant changes to current electrical generation and network techniques. After Fly by wire, the Power by Wire concept (PbW) will enhance aircraft design and use by power source rationalisation and electrical power flexibility. This will be achieved by developing the necessary design principles, technologies and standards.  Over a 3-year period, MOET will permit to: - Validate scalable electrical networks up to 1MW considering new voltages and advanced concepts including system transformation of future air, actuation and electrical systems into all electrical solutions, - Assess the PbW concept integration at aircraft level considering a more composite environment and the interfaces with the avionics world, - Build a design environment aiming to design and validate standardised solutions and a coherent set of platforms open to the full supply chain, in order to develop an optimised high performance PbW concept.  MOET is a consortium of 62 European partners from 15 countries composed of universities, research centres a broad range of aircraft, system and component manufacturers representing the whole supply chain who are ready to set up the PbW standard.

There is no effective treatment for such neuropathies. CMT1A is the most frequent subtype, and is due to the excessive expression of the peripheral myelin protein PMP22. Transgenic animal models can reproduce the human disease. A recent study showed that CMT1A mice treated with ascorbic acid (AA, the common Vitamin C) have much less severe neuropathy as compared to untreated controls, as shown by clinical and histologic findings. Some clinical parameters even improved during treatment. Further experiments confirmed that AA reduces PMP22 expression. A clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of AA treatment in CMT1A patients is feasible and warranted, as Vitamin C is devoid of significant side effects and easily available. The efficacy of ascorbic acid treatment will be assessed through a multicentric, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial. At least 202 patients will be recruited and randomly assigned to AA treatment (1,5 gram daily) or to placebo, for two years. Clinical and electrophysiological evaluations (employing internationally validated impairment, disability, and quality of life scales, according to an internationally agreed core protocol) will be performed before treatment and after 6-12-18-24 months. Efficacy of therapy will be assessed by comparing outcome measures in AA and placebo treated groups. Skin biopsy to study PMP22 expression and its possible modification with therapy will be performed in a subgroup of patients at the beginning and at the end of treatment. The study will allow a definite statement on efficacy of a low-cost therapy for one of the most frequent inherited neuromuscular disorder; furthermore, an improvement in outcome assessment, homogeneously performed in a co-ordinated network of centres, for future trials will be obtained.

Reading Vesuvio's Eruptions through a Geo-Archaeological tour in the city of Naples|"Naples is located in a very special area, with geological aspects that make it truly unique: it is a seismic area towered over by an active volcano and the entire area, including the islands in the Gulf, is volcanic. This provides the city with great richness in terms of fertility, energy, springs and unique ruins such as Pompeii and Ercolano, but it also represents a great and constant menace that people often forget (no evacuation plan could be successful since the area around Mt. Vesuvius is so densely populated).  The idea of dedicating Researchers' Night to Vesuvius and to earth science (as main keywords) has several objectives: draw nearer researchers to public highlighting the essential nature of research and its association to life in this area and, in respect of a different field of science such as archaeology, to remind us of who we are, to remind people that Mt. Vesuvius isn't a mountain and that it could be dangerous; to remind them how the volcano's presence has affected people, history and society. In brief, the idea is to dedicate a virtual and real itinerary to disciplines that are essential to anyone living near Mt. Vesuvius and to localize this itinerary in the ancient centre of Naples, in the ""Decumans"" of the Roman era (reproducing the same layout as Pompeii and Ercolano), with the addition of cultural and amusing events.  The principal activities are: A temporary ""museum"" of the Vesuvian Observatory in Piazza Dante Temporary exhibits of researchers' work and life in the numerous coffee bars of Piazza Bellini ""Research and Adventure"" dialogs, scientific demonstration and videos in Piazza Bellini, prepared by researchers of the National Institute for Applied Optics Guided geological and architectural tours through the decumans Theatrical performances in the area of the ancient Roman theatre Concert of electronic music in the Cloister of the San Pietro a Majella Conservatory."

Quality and wholesomeness of food and food products are two issues addressed prominently by society especially in relation to obesity (and atherosclerosis), the most important cause of cardiovascular disease, age-related dise ases, such as cancer and diabetes and to the increasing preference of consumers for ???regional??? and ???niche??? food specialties. Additionally producers are challenged by environmental constraints such as diminishing fresh water supplies and climate cha nge that undermine stability of production. The strategic objectives of EU-SOL are to understand the factors that affect consumer-driven and environmentally-directed quality of the two most important vegetable products in the EU, tomato fruits and potato tubers, both belonging to the Solanaceae. To this end, EU-SOL will attempt to dissect the genetic and molecular components that control these quality traits by applying state-of-the-art knowledge and technologies. EU-SOL particularly focuses on mapping, is olation and characterization of genes responsible for traits important for consumers and processors (health, nutrition, flavour, fragrance, soluble solids, texture, colour, shelf-life) as well as for producers (abiotic stress: cold, heat, drought, salt), a nd the mechanisms underlying these traits (control of gene activity, regulatory networks). To accomplish these objectives EU-SOL will explore and exploit the natural biodiversity related to these quality traits that are largely unexplored and hardly used i n current commercial varieties. EU-SOL will apply genomics and post-genomics research approaches and will contribute to the International Solanaceae Genome Initiative.

This collaboration meets every few years and involves around 600 trialists. The published findings have had a major impact on cancer research, resulting in new trials to address important treatment questions that had yet to be reliably addressed. An example of such a trial is the ongoing ATLAS trial, which is run from CTSU and involves more than a 1,000 collaborating doctors in 38 countries, has randomised 13,000 women to either 5 or 10 years treatment with tamoxifen, and has shown that longer treatment improves 15 year survival. The published research findings of the collaboration have also had a major impact on the treatment of breast cancer. It has been referenced in evidence-based guidelines worldwide, including those published by the UK National Institute of Clinical Excellence, NICE. While the long-term survival gains identified from the research of the collaboration are each only moderate, the combination of several of these moderate gains have resulted in a halving of breast cancer mortality in the UK for women aged 35-69.  Technical Summary The programme will continue the long-running Early Breast Cancer Triallists’ Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) and the ATLAS trial follow-up to obtain large-scale randomised evidence about the long-term main effects and side-effects of local and systemic adjuvant breast cancer treatments, and influence the interpretation of past trials and the design of future trials of treatment and screening. About every 5 years, EBCTCG seeks data on each individual patients in all adjuvant breast trials, for checking and meta-analyses and has previously demonstrated effects on mortality not reliably demonstrable in separate trials. EBCTGCG reports (>14,000 citations) influence practice guidelines and change worldwide treatment patterns. The long-term survival gains identified are each only moderate, but, from the combination of several moderate gains, UK breast cancer mortality at age 35-69 has been halved. The collaboration has also shown that 5-year tamoxifen reduces 10-year and 15-year breast cancer mortality rates by 1/3. It was feared that continuing tamoxifen for more than 5 years might increase rather than decrease recurrence, but CTSU’s ATLAS trial (n=13,000) randomised 10-year vs 5-year tamoxifen and showed 10-year continuation moderately lowers 15-year mortality. Follow-up of ATLAS is continuing, as ER+ disease can recur throughout years 10-20.

On the other hand humans always used fire as a tool to regulate nature and traditional use of fire is known in many regions of Europe. The understanding of this paradox, is thus essential for finding solutions for integrated wildland fire management.This concept requires considering the various aspects of fire, from its use as a planned management practice (prescribed fire) to the initiation and propagation of unplanned fires (wildfires) and to the use of fire in fighting wildfires (suppression fire). Prescribed or suppression fires will therefore set the limits for wildfires by vontrolling their spatial extent, intensity and impacts.This is the main approach adopted aiming at the creation of the scientific and technological bases for new practices and policies under integrated wildland fire management and in the development of strategies for its implementation in Europe. Three major domains of related activities were considered: research, development and dissemination.In research, the project will focus on understanding the machanisms and modelling the processes associated with fire, from physics to biology and social sciences. Experimental and sampling methods will be used. The scientific and technical knowledge gathered will allow the development of a technological platform that will integrate the fire model, the temporal and spatial variability of fuels and weather, and the potential ecological and social-economical impacts. Documentation and demonstration platforms will also be extensively used for dissemination, focusing in the development of stategies for public awarness, academic and professional training using new communication technologies and networks, and for the implementation of new practices, policies and regulations under the concept of integrated wildland fire management.

Europe already has a competitive position based on patents and expertises, represented here, and NovelQ will extend and strengthen this competitive advantage. High pressure, pulsed electrical field, cold plasma and advanced heating technologies [together with optimal packaging schemes to avoid migration problems] are included. New products and processes will be developed and demonstrated (10 examples). The IAP will exploit and promote these and identify bottlenecks to be examined in the project. Food manufacturers and machinery suppliers are involved to optimise cross-sectorial innovations. Best practices will be disseminated in (new) Member States/INCO countries via established networks. Opportunities will be promoted for healthy and differentiated quality foods produced via NP approaches that are sustainable and eco-friendly. This innovative approach involves consortium of 25 experienced partners and over 30 industries. The management of the project, highly experienced in innovation projects, will create an innovation culture; consortium partners represent all segments of the innovation circle and the project is led by an organisation highly experienced in FP6 ??? best practices in management/administration will thus be readily included and absorbed. The consortium has access to all basic, expensive, pilot NP facilities including unique prototypes, owned by the partners. These factors, together with the priority paid to effective dissemination and technology transfer, will ensure maximum stakeholder impact of NovelQ. Younger scientists and women researchers will gain research experience and will be trained so as to make them better communicators and team players ??? hence, better able to exploit the opportunities of the ERA.

Current conventional methods for worm control involve repeated dosing of whole herds with synthetic anthelmintics but are unsustainable due to the food and environmental residues produced and promote the spread of anthelmintic resistance by failing to leave an untreated parasite refugium.  Effective chemical anthelmintics remain irreplaceable for worm control and their elimination is not practical on animal welfare and economic grounds. We will replace current practice with Targeted Selective Treatments, where only animals showing clinical symptoms or reduced productivity are given drugs. Animals with low worm burdens are symptomless and do not require treatment. We will assess several innovative methods, under various farming conditions, for identifying animals that require treatment, and produce and standardise tests for anthelmintic resistance to ensure that the drugs are effective. We will produce, by the end of the project, clear guidance and protocols for sustainable, low-input, user- and consumer-friendly nematode control.  In order to do this we will: (1) assess the effect of targeted selective treatments on productivity, animal welfare and the spread of anthelmintic resistance genes under a range of farming conditions; (2) determine the best methods of identifying animals and herds requiring anthelmintic intervention; (3) standardise existing in vivo and in vitro tests for detecting anthelmintic resistance and develop new tests for where current ones are inadequate; (4) optimise the efficacy and bio-availability of anthelmintics by modulating parasite P-glycoprotein detoxification systems; and (5) communicate with farmers, veterinarians and advisors, to produce and disseminate guidance to ensure good uptake and implementation of the protocols produced.

However, some of these Maillard products called Neo-Formed Contaminants are currently suspected to have deleterious health effects. The recent discovery of neo-formed acrylamide in a variety of fried and baked foods has highlighted the fact that agro-food enterprises and especially SMEs are poorly prepared to face this emerging issue. Because of a lack of knowledge and inappropriate analytical and technological tools, SMEs are presently not able to control the impact of the different steps of the process on the NFC level.  In this context, the ICARE project is dedicated to: - Reinforce the technological basis of the agro-food sector in order to understand and control NFC formation in industrial foodstuffs; - Develop a rapid and cost-effective analytical method in order to enable SMEs to monitor the NFC level all along the production line - Increase the knowledge base of SMEs by providing them a customized training - Perform pre-normative research in order to provide EU regulatory authorities with a fast method for NFC quantification & a data base of NFC levels in food and their impact on health.  ICARE will provide European agro food SMEs with appropriate means to produce foods with reduced NFC rate and valorise such added-value products: guidelines of manufacturers' practices, alternative solutions to heat treatments, analytical methods to control the process and quantify the NFC levels, related training for lAGs and SMEs, clinical data and economical studies providing elements to implement a communication strategy toward consumers. The proposed 3-years project will bring together 5 European lAGs representing 9200 SMEs that will be highly responsible for the training and dissemination activities, 14 SMEs and 7 RTDs.

A way to make public spending on healthcare more efficient is to ensure that the money is spent on legitimate causes. The project aims to design and develop a flexible fraud detection web services platform, which will be able to serve e-government processes of fraud detection and prevention, in order to ensure quality and accuracy and minimise loss of health care funds.  The platform will be accessible via Internet from actors involved in the heath care business. They will be able to detect erroneous or suspicious records in submitted health care data sets, ensuring homogeneity and consistency and promoting awareness and harmonization of fraud detection practices among health care systems in the EU. Critical project objectives include, development of an ontology of health care data associated with semantic rules, implementation and initial population of an ontology and rules repository, development of a fraud detection engine and implementation of a self-learning module, which will be able to learn new rules from suitable data and properly update the central rules repository.  iWebCare impact can be substantial. More money on healthcare mean better healthcare. Living conditions, and the trust of citizens in public healthcare will be improved. This may lead to reduction of private expenditure on healthcare and money saved can be invested on other activities. Finally, iWebCare will also improve working conditions and performance in the administrations financing public healthcare. The development of the platform offers large exploitation potential, as fraud detection is needed in all forms of government-citizen interaction where some form of financial claim is involved. The commercial target of the platform initially, will be public and private providers of healthcare insurance.
100|grant.3766417|6438; 75922; EPIC|European Prospective Investigation into Cancer, Chronic Diseases, Nutrition and Lifestyle|European Prospective Investigation into Cancer, Chronic Diseases, Nutrition and Lifestyle|EPIC is the largest prospective cohort study on diet, lifestyle and chronic disease worldwide. It includes 522,000 middle-aged subjects. Diet and lifestyle data were collected at baseline. Blood samples were collected and stored at -196C. EPIC was initiated to elucidate the complex relationships between nutrition and related metabolic characteristics and the causation/prevention of cancer, coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke. The main goal of this CA is to reinforce and expand collaboration between 23 European institutes to ensure that this major European resource will produce a large mass of data relevant for the identification of nutritional and environmental causes of cancer and other chronic diseases and that this knowledge will contribute to the development of effective public health strategies for the prevention of cancer, CHD and stroke. 7 technical WPs cover major areas of epidemiological/public health interest: diet, alcohol, tobacco, obesity and physical activity (PA), socioeconomic factors, biomarkers of exposure and statistical methods.

Three kinds of integration will be analized: (a) Human-softbot integration, as achieved by AI research on information and communication tec hnologies; (b) Human-robot, non-invasive integration, as achieved by robotic research on autonomous systems inhabiting human environments; (c) Physical, invasive integration, as achieved by bionic research. Crucial ethical issues in these areas include th e preservation of human identity, and integrity; applications of precautionary principles; economic and social discrimination; artificial system autonomy and accountability; responsibilities for (possibly unintended) warfare applications; nature and impact of human-machine cognitive and affective bonds on individuals and society. The proposed coordinated work will enable one to establish a techno-ethically aware community of researchers, at a European level, by promoting workshops, training and disseminatio n activities. Moreover, the proposed CA aims at developing the capability of researchers to communicate in understandable ways with journalists, policy makers, concerned citizens, and wider audiences of non-specialists. A knowledge-base on techno-ethical i ssues will be set up to serve both internal and external dissemination purposes. Finally, ETHICBOTS will provide inputs to EU and national institutions for techno-ethical monitoring, warning, and opinion generation. In each of these activities, ETHICBOTS a ims at shifting attention from limitation to encouragement, guidance, and promotion of responsible scientific and technological research.

The enzyme deficiency results in tissue accumulation of glycogen. The clinical picture of the disease shares similarities with neuromuscular disorders, with a severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and muscle hypotonia eventually leading to respiratory failure.The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of specific small molecules on alpha-glucosidase activity in cells from patients with Pompe disease, and to provide the rationale for a possible alternative therapeutic approach to this inherited metabolic disorder, such as enzyme enhancement (EE).The effects on skeletal muscle of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), currently employed in clinical trials as a therapy for Pompe disease, appear variable. There is experimental evidence suggesting that skeletal muscle involvement may not be completely reverted by ERT. Alternative therapeutic approaches, such as EE, may be of help particularly in the treatment of patients with the non-classic infantile and late onset forms of Pompe disease, characterized by a major involvement of skeletal muscle without significant cardiomyopathy.In the proposed study the enhancement effect on alpha-glucosidase activity of specific small molecules, such as iminosugars, will be investigated, as well as the mechanism implicated in the enhancing effect.It is possible that this research may indicate the feasibility of EE in infantile non-classic and late-onset Pompe disease, as a therapeutic option alternative to ERT.

CD affects as much as 1% of the Europeans. The health burden of CD is siderably and the negative eomical sequences for society are extensive. The last years an impressive amount of research work on CD has been produced by different European groups and many immunological, genetic and epidemiological factors implicated in CD have been clarified. However, there is a fundamental gap between the groups of researchers working on the basic scientific aspects of CD (immunology, genetics, cereal chemistry) and those working on the clinical and social aspects of the disease (preventive and curative medicine, food industry). The aim of this SSA is to close the gap between basic science on CD and applications of its results in prevention, clinical treatment and food industry. By European collaboration among leaders from disciplines beyond those traditionally used, among others from academia, patient organisations and industry, we will form a platform to generate the scientific basis for innovative research on primary prevention and effective treatment of CD, taking full advantage of genomics/proteomics techniques. To achieve our aims we propose: 1) to organise two European workshops with leading scientific experts, representatives from the industry, coeliac patients organizations and health experts from the European Community, in order to 2) create an operational European Multi-stakeholder Platform of experts on CD from crosscutting research areas, to promote future integrated European research in CD and 3) to offer recommendations to the FP6 and FP7 program on a common European research strategy on novel methods for prevention and treatment of CD by integrating basic science with clinical applications and involvement of European industry.

To date, efforts to develop a truly prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine have been hindered by difficult y in identifying immunogens that elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies. This lack of significant cross-protection raises further concerns on the capacity of classical Env-based vaccines to afford substantial protection against field isolates. Indeed, curr ent unmodified gp120 or gp140 envelope-based vaccines in human subjects have shown little or no protection from heterologous HIV-1 isolates such as would be encountered in the field. This indicates that vaccine trials with currently available immunogens wi ll afford low percentages of protection with a large number of vaccine breakthroughs and will raise ethical and financial issues concerning the treatment of any volunteers who become infected. It is of the highest priority that a focused effort is undertak en to develop novel Env antigens capable of inducing broad and potent neutralising antibodies to a wide variety of strains. Consistently, this consortium is developing a new generation of Env antigens based on complex but conserved epitopes to induce broad neutralising antibodies. This objective will be achieved by two complementary strategies: a. Screening of Random Peptide Libraries with novel MAbs that neutralise primary HIV-1 isolates assigned to distinct clades; b. designing of 30-40 amino acid peptide s that mimic discontinuous regions of gp120 and gp41 that are sensitive to neutralization by antibodies and are conserved among HIV strains of distinct clades. These include the CD4-binding domain, the bridging sheet and the pre-fusogenic harpin loop of gp 41. In this two years proposal the novel vaccine candidates will be validated in mice; however, the Consortium is endowed with the facilities and resources to proceed to monkeys models of HIV-1 infection.

The slow dynamics and structural arrest associated to it display many feat ures in common with the dynamics of glassy systems, but actually in gelling systems they are directly related to the formation of stable and metastable structures. Therefore it is not obvious that the mechanisms which produce the slow dynamics are the same as in the glass transition.The study of this problem has a great interest, due both to the great relevance of gelling systems (colloids, polymer, proteins...) in our practical life and to the many fundamental implications in the physics of soft matter and disordered systems.This project is aimed to study gelation phenomena by means of numerical simulations. The objectives are the understanding of the interplay between the structure formation and slow dynamics in attractive colloidal systems, the achievemen t of a satisfactory modelization of colloidal gelation and a deeper comprehension of the analogies with the glass transition. We will use molecular dynamics and MonteCarlo simulations on the lattice, which are at the moment the most powerful tools to stud y these systems.The project will allow the applicant to integrate the competences she has developped during her post-doc experience (a Marie Curie Individual Fellowship) within the host group. She will work as a senior post-doc in the host group, with th e possibility of experiencing the training of PhD students and young post-docs.This willhelp her to develop her ability to define and run an independent research programme and will give her the possibility to access to a permanent position at University a nd Research Institutions.

The aim is to produce health promoting and safe cereal foods and ingredients of high eating quality. A whole grain diet is increasingly demonstrated to be protective against development of diet related disorders such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.   HEALTHGRAIN will carry out an integrated, multidisciplinary effort to establish the variation, process-induced changes and human metabolism of bioactive compounds in the major European bread grains, and to reveal the physiological mechanisms underlying their significance in prevention of metabolic syndrome and related diseases.   The target bioactive compounds are vitamins (folate, tocols,choline etc.), phytochemicals (lignans, sterols, alkylresorcinols, phenolic acids) and indigestible carbohydrates. Also other product characteristics that may add to the metabolic benefits of whole grain products are promoted.   The research is carried out in five research modules:  * Consumer research: Studies in four European countries are made to understand consumer expectations of healthy cereal foods, and to give basis for dissemination practises. * Grain improvement and biotechnology toolkit: Plant biotechnology, including ""omics technologies"", is used to identify and generate new sources of nutritionally enhanced grain and to provide a ""biotechnology toolkit"" for plant breeding programmes.  * Technology and processing: New fractionation and bio processing methods are developed to allow for incorporation of more of the whole grains and their outer parts in consumer foods with sensory quality appealing to European consumers.  * Nutrition and metabolism: Bioavailability of bioactive compounds is determined, and their role as well as that of glycemic properties of cereal foods."

DOUBLE BLIND, PLACEBO CONTROLLED TRIAL OF ASCORBIC ACID TREATMENT IN CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE TYPE 1A (CMT1A)|Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is the most frequent neuromuscular hereditary disorder, although it is classified among the so-called rare diseases. There is no effective treatment for such neuropathies. CMT1A is the most frequent subtype, and is due to the excessive expression of the peripheral myelin protein PMP22. Transgenic animal models can reproduce the human disease. A recent study showed that CMT1A mice treated with ascorbic acid (AA, the common Vitamin C) have much less severe neuropathy as compared to untreated controls, as shown by clinical and histologic findings. Some clinical parameters even improved during treatment. Further experiments confirmed that AA reduces PMP22 expression. A clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of AA treatment in CMT1A patients is feasible and warranted, as Vitamin C is devoid of significant side effects and easily available. The efficacy of ascorbic acid treatment will be assessed through a multicentric, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial. Two hundreds patients will be recruited and randomly assigned to AA treatment (1 gram daily) or to placebo, for two years. Clinical and electrophysiological evaluations (employing internationally validated impairment, disability, and quality of life scales) will be performed before treatment and after 6-12-18-24 months. Skin biopsy to determine skin sensory fibre density will be performed in a subgroup of patients at the beginning and at the end of treatment. Efficacy of therapy will be assessed by comparing outcome measures in AA and placebo treated groups. The study will allow a definite statement on efficacy of a low-cost therapy for one of the most frequent inherited neuromuscular disorder; furthermore, an improvement in outcome assessment, homogeneously performed in a co-ordinated network of centres, for future trials will be obtained.

In spite of scientific advance, non-communicable diseases are still the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in Europe. Most of these diseases have their origin during childhood and adolescence, but the relationship between the development of non-communicable diseases and the adolescence process is poorly understood. The interactions between the environment, the genetic predisposition and growth in children and adolescents have not been studied yet. Adolescence is a crucial period in life and implies multiple physiological and psychological changes that affect nutritional needs and habits. Many healthy (or unhealthy) life-long habits begin in adolescence. The HELENA proposal includes cross-sectional, crossover and pilot community intervention multi-centre studies, as an integrated approach to the above-mentioned problem. The following aspects will be studied: (1) dietary intake, nutrition knowledge and eating attitudes; (2) food choices and preferences (3) body composition; (4) plasma lipids and metabolic profile; (5) vitamin status; (6) immune function related to nutritional status; (7) physical activity and fitness; and (8) genotype (to analyse gene-nutrient and gene-environment interactions). The requeriments for health promoting foods will also be identified, and several sensory acceptable products for adolescents will be developed. Both scientific and technological objectives should result in reliable and comparable data of a representative sample of European adolescents. This will tribute to understand why health-related messages are not being as effective as expected in the adolescent population; and to propose a realistic intervention strategy in order to try to achieve the goals of understanding and effectively enhancing nutritional and lifestyle habits of adolescents in Europe.

This proposed industry-academia interchange addresses key step changes necessary to reali se EU targets by enabling the use of bio-components and by improving combustion and lubrication efficiency. The optimization of fuel composition (including effective biofuel introduction) is critical for automotive engine and catalyst technologies for the period 2010-2020. Understanding lubricant oxidation behaviour is key to improving engine and machine efficiency. The modeling of oxidation kinetics, the thread that underpins this proposal, is the common scientific fundamental for fuel and lubricant scien ce. Long-term collaborative relationships will be established between Shell Global Solutions, the coordinating host organisation (at their two research sites in Chester and Hamburg) and eight partner universities (Dublin, Eindhoven, Heidelberg, Istanbul, L ulea, Napoli, Stockholm and Thessaloniki). This will link their collective combustion and lubrication scientific knowledge directly with Shell GS' longstanding R and D capability in fuel and lubricant formulation. In the first two years, experienced univer sity researchers will participate in multi-disciplinary R and D projectscarried out at Shell GS. An annual one-week workshop will bring together all the participants (researchers, industrial and university supervisors, and an advisory board), enabling new technical synergies to be established. Industry approaches to the commercialization of knowledge will be conveyed to each university via an annual two-week visit by a senior Shell researcher. To demonstrate commitment to a durable collaboration, Shell GS w ill pay for services equivalent to the cost of the researchers' reintegration year.

To contribute to alleviate these pollution problems in Uzbekistan, the research proposal has the objective to investigate on the effect of the molecular characteristics of locally produced natural organic matter or humic substances (HUM) and lignins (LIG) on the detoxification and degradation of pollutants such as the main pesticides used in local agriculture and other halogenated anthropogenic compounds which have been recognized as persistent organic pollutants (POP) in the Uzbekistan agricultural soils. Moreover, the proposal wants to study further the molecular properties and reactivity of some nicotine-like alkaloids obtained from the wastes of the local tobacco production and alkaloids from other agricultural plants which may show detoxification activity towards the same pollutants. The research will focus on the development of sustainable extraction methods of natural organic matter, lignins and plant alkaloids of large availability in the agricultural production of Uzbekistan . In particular, environmentally compatible ionic liquids will be adopted to extract the plant alkaloids. All natural extracts will be subjected to a detailed molecular characterization and their interactions, as single materials or as combined formulations, with the selected POP will be followed before and after aging processes in order to determine their potential in adsorption-desorption of pollutants. In the case of the plant-derived alkaloids, the effect of specific catalysts, for either homogenous or heterogeneous catalysis, will be employed to increase the rate of POP degradation. In all experiments, the POP metabolites will be isolated and characterized in order to reach a sound understanding of the mechanisms of POP degradation occurring in the presence of the natural extracts.  The development of a technology employing materials containing the described natural products will represent an advance in the capacity of Uzbekistan to implement the necessary programs of environmental remediation. Moreover, the scientific results of this research may become a source of industrial activity related to the environmental control business and a possible new commercial opportunity for Uzbekistan.

For a fixed engine cycle, the margin of progress depends on the combustor technology. Lean combustion is the breakthrough which should enable high-level reductions in NOx emissions both during the LTO cycle (air quality) and at cruise speeds (global impact). In addition, lean combustion also enhances particulate reduction. Injection systems form the most critical issue in achieving a satisfactory level of lean combustion and will be the technological focus for the project. Within this framework, a wide range of experiments will be carried out on mono-sector or tubular combustors. This new program will be a crucial effort in achieving sufficient maturity for the single annular combustor application. The objectives will be an 80% reduction in NOx emissions in relation to the CAEP2 regulation limit during the LTO cycle, and low NOx emission indices at cruise speed (EINOx=5g/kg as target). Other gaseous emissions and soot performance characteristics will be also precisely evaluated.In this prospect, the project will support the adaptation of most advanced, non-intrusive laser-based measurement techniques to combustorsactual conditions and their application (in addition to intrusive techniques) to experiments of various concepts of injection systems. The injection systems tested will derive from the LOPOCOTEP program or other projects and from advanced CFD optimization of new concepts. The entire range of operating conditions will be experimentally evaluated (LTO points, cruise speeds). Auto-ignition and flashback risk issue as well as lean extinction limit will be assessed. Advanced CFD simulation will also exploit the data from the fundamental experiments, thereby enabling calibration of the latest codes in emissions predictions.

The technical focus of the university driven proposal, AEROMAG which has been prepared in close collaboration to the Network of Universities ""EASN"" is the development of new Magnesium wrought products (sheets and extrusions), that provide significantly improved static and fatigue strength properties. The strength properties of these innovative materials are required to be as high as AA5083 for non-structural applications and as high as AA2024 aluminium alloys for secondary structure applications. At first new alloys will be developed and existing alloys will be tested. Appropriate manufacturing (rolling, extrusion), forming and joining technologies require development, simulation and validation for the innovative material and application. Corrosion is a problem to be solved with newly adapted and environmentally friendly surface protection systems and advanced design concepts. Flammability will be addressed with addition of chemical elements and special surface treatments. A further essential task is the development of material models and failure criteria for the prediction of forming processes, plastic deformation and failure behaviour of components. Finally material adapted design and the evaluation of structural behaviour will be investigated to close the process and development chain for aeronautic components. The technological objective is a weight reduction of fuselage parts, systems and interior components up to 35%. The strategic objectives are an increase in the operational capacity of 10%, a reduction in the direct operating cost of 10% and finally a reduction in the fuel consumption of 10% and therefore a reduced environmental impact."

100|grant.3807714|512397; 73661; EN-CORE|Understanding the dynamics of cell divisioneuropean network for composite reinforcement|Understanding the dynamics of cell divisioneuropean network for composite reinforcement|Construction is facing its first major revolution in the use of new materials since the introduction of Reinforced Concrete (RC) more than a century ago. Advanced composites in the form of Fibre Reinforced Polymers (FRP) have been adopted in most strengthe ning applications and are being progressively used as reinforcement in new structures. The market for FRP in construction is expected to increase between 5 and 7 times in the next decade. This will lead to more durable structures and give a boost to the ai ling composites industry, an industry that is struggling to recover in the post cold war era and is in desperate need for diversification. Though research on FRP currently dominates the field of structural engineering much of this research is u ncoordinated and mostly fails to address fundamental scientific issues in any substantial depth. Moreover, despite the fact that a first generation of design guidelines has been produced, these are conservative and, in certain applications, undermine the u se of composites. Standard tests for defining the short and long term properties of FRP in RC are yet not available. The main aims of the project are to address specific scientific challenges in the field and develop tests and models to help wi th the standardisation process and to bridge the gap between academia and industry so as to accelerate the transfer of knowledge and adoption of FRP in construction. The network comprises a cohesive and complementary team of top experts in the field from 9 different countries. The network aims to create the ideal environment for delivering the best training for young researchers in the field of FRP reinforcement using a variety of delivery modalities, including an Intensive research training co urse, Young Researchers Conferences and industry mentoring. This network is anticipated to become the seed for the creation of a cohesive European Research Area in this field, which will lead Internationally.
100|grant.3768488|513967; 74167; BIOTOXMARIN|Development of novel analytic tools for the detection of marine biotoxins|Development of novel analytic tools for the detection of marine biotoxins|The contamination of seafood with algal toxins can cause severe neuronal and gastrointestinal disorders but also allergies in human. Sporadic outbreaks of poisoning by ingestion of shellfish which have accumulated marine biotoxins have become a world-wide problem. The economic consequences caused by the production of marine biotoxins during algal blooms in the coastal regions are enormous. In this project, fast, simple and cost-effective detection methods for marine biotoxins in seafood as well as patient sera will be developed, based on the application of high-affinity capture antibodies and novel artificial receptor mimics against the toxins. The applicants already succeeded in raising antibodies against okadaic acid, a diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) toxin. This promising strategy will now be extended to other groups of relevant toxins causing paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP) or amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP). The new tools for the detection (and quantification) of marine biotoxins developed in the proposed project are based on the application of the new Polymer Instruction technology and the highly sensitive Integrated Optical Grating Coupler (IOGC) biosensor technology, and the use of high-affinity antibodies for sensitive ELISA und Western blotting techniques based on an infrared-fluorescence imaging system.

Prion diseases have received an enormous amount of publicity in Europe and recently in the US due to MAD COW DISEASE (BSE) and its possible spread to humans following ingestion of contaminated material. These diseases can be included in the lager family of amyloidogenic neurological disorders, eg,Alzheimer disease, all of which are fatal and are characterised by spongiform degeneration of the brain and of deposition of amyloid plaques. For all these diseases the primary cause of neurodegeneration is not yet known, but we believe that a common mechanism might be involved. Genetic Prion diseases are linked to germlines mutations in a gene on chromosone 20 (Prnp) which encodes the PrPc protein, an endogenous cellular protein of yet unknown function which undergoes to a pathological conversion to an isoform called PrPSc (prion). PrPSc is believed to catalyse its own replication by converting the endogenous protein into the pathological conformation in a self propagating reaction. The cellular basis of this conversion is not known. From our preliminary data and from data present in the literature, we postulate that alterations in the intracellular trafficking od PrPc have an important role in the pathological conversion as well as in the functional impairment of the protein which may lead to neurodegeneration. Therefore we propose to analyse the metabolism and the intracellular transport of different PrP mutants and compare them with the normal endogenous protein in neuronal cultures. We believe that this study will help understanding the pathogenesis of prion and other neurodegenerative diseases and will provide novel therapeutical and diagnostical approaches.

The hydro-mechanical behaviour of unsaturated soils is considerably more complex than that of saturated soils, and understanding within unsaturated soil mechanics lag considerably behind the state of-the-art in saturated soil mechanics. This is a significant limitation, because the hydro-mechanical behaviour of unsaturated soils is crucial to many applications in civil engineering (e.g. damage to structures founded on unsaturated soils and performance of flood embankments and earth dams), the nuclear industry (design of underground waste repositories), geohazards engineering (slope instabilities) and geo-environmental engineering (pollution migration and containment).The first objective of the proposed Network on Mechanics of Unsaturated Soils for Engineering is to generate an unrivalled database of suction-controlled experimental data on the engineering behaviour of different categories of unsaturated soils, including complex soils such as expansive clays and cemented soils. Experimental results will be used in the development and validation of improved constitutive models accounting for complex aspects of behaviour. Constitutive models will be implemented in FE programs and this will form part of a process of developing improved numerical capabilities for analysing coupled boundary value problems. The final objective is to demonstrate and validate the application of the constitutive and numerical modelling capabilities to a range of practical problems by simulating case histories and field trials. A particular feature of the Network is benchmarking of laboratory techniques, constitutive models and FE codes i.e. investigating the robustness of a particular approach by showing whether the same results are achieved by different teams or using different procedures, models or code...

These abnormalities impair glucose metabolism leading to chronic hyperglycemia and the life-threating complications of diabetes. In most affected patients, the gene(s) causing susceptibility to type 2 diabetes is still unknown, however.We have recently shown that the function of the PED gene is commonly increased in type 2 diabetics. In transgenic animal models, this same defect may lead to diabetes by impairing insulin action on adipose tissue and/or insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta-cells. As the mechanism of PED dysregulation of insulin action has been extensively investigated, we will now focus on those responsible for the impaired beta-cell function. In addition, we propose to clarify the relative contribution of the adipose tissue and beta-cell districts to PED-caused derangement in glucose utilization. To accomplish these tasks, we will analyze beta-cell function in genetically modified animals in which PED gene activity is either increased (transgenics) or knocked-down. To define the consequences of PED expression, we will compare major signalling mechanisms controlling beta-cell functions in these in these and in normal animals. We also plan to generate further transgenic mice featuring increased PED gene expression selectively in the adipose tissue or in the beta-cells. Analysis of these animals will reveal which tissue causes deranged glucose utilization when PED gene features abnormally increased function. This new information will enable us, in the future, to devise targeted strategies to correct PED gene defect and to prevent its consequences in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

Vulnerability of populated areas to natural disaster is partly a consequence of spatial planning policies that failed to take account of hazards and risks in land use zoning/development decisions. Thus it is important to combine knowledge, technology and actors in the field of risk assessment and land use zoning to achieve effective natural disaster prevention and mitigation. The overall aim of ARMONIA is to provide the EU with a set of harmonised methodologies for producing integrated risk maps to achieve effective spatial planning procedures in areas prone to natural disasters in Europe. Objectives to be achieved by ARMONIA are: - integration/optimisation of methodologies for hazard/risk assessment for different types of potentially disastrous events; - harmonisation of different risk mapping processes for standardizing data collection/analysis, monitoring, outputs and terminology for end users (multi-hazard risk assessment); - design of and proposal for a harmonised decision-making tool structure for applying hazard and risk mitigation in spatial planning and of a guideline on natural hazard mitigation in the context of the EU Environmental Assessment Directive (2001/42/EC). ARMONIA seeks to achieve outcomes that can mitigate the adverse effects of natural phenomena through joint effort of the scientific community, technology experts and users. The target is not only a scientific output, but a measurable impact on policies/practices for disaster mitigation initiated within the period of the project. ARMONIA fits with Europe's goals regarding sustainable development in supporting environmental and security policies by facilitating and fostering the timely provision of quality data, information and knowledge, developing tools and improving management practices.

The project tackles the important subject of the seismic protection of historical and monumental buildings, namely of constructions dating back from the ancient age up to the mid of the 20th century. The objective is to develop sustainable methodologies for the use of reversible mixed technologies in the seismic protection of existing constructions, with particular emphasis to buildings of historical and artistic interest. Reversible mixed technologies exploit the peculiarities of innovative materials and special devices, allowing ease of removal if necessary. At the same time, the combined use of different materials and techniques yields an optimisation of the global behaviour under seismic actions. The endpoint of the research is a proposal of codification for the use of such technologies in the seismic protection of existing constructions, which will meet the most up-to-dated codification issues at European level and will comply with layout, language and philosophy of structural Eurocodes. The research program involves 15 academic institutions coming from 12 Countries mostly belonging to the South European and Mediterranean area. The work plan is based on 12 scientific work packages, plus 3 management work packages. A number of 12 scientific workpackage deliverables is foreseen. The scientific activity is broken down into 4 parts, aiming at producing 4 main deliverables in 3 years, which are intended to yield a significant advancement of the state of the art in the field of seismic protection.

Mitigating this risk requires integrated and coordinated action that embraces a wide range of organisations and disciplines. For this reason, the LESSLOSS IP is formulated by a large number of European Centres of excellence in earthquake and geotechnical engineering integrating in the traditional fields of engineers and earth scientists some expertise of social scientists, economists, urban planners and information technologists. The LESSLOSS project addresses natural disasters, risk and impact assessment, natural hazard monitoring, mapping and management strategies, improved disaster preparedness and mitigation, development of advanced methods for risk assessment, methods of appraising environmental quality and relevant pre-normative research. In order for the multi-disciplinary S&T ingredients of the project to be tackled in an efficient and productive manner, the research programme has been split into three distinct areas: physical environment, urban areas and infrastructures. For each one of this areas four main types of transversal fields have been identified as fundamental and capable of producing permanent effects on risk mitigation: (i) instrumentation and monitoring, (ii) methods and technologies to reduce vulnerability, (iii) innovative approaches for design/assessment and (iv) disaster scenarios and loss modelling. Within this general framework, specific objectives will be pursued, such as the development of innovative methods and approaches to design and assessment of structures and earth slopes for both short- and long-term implementation, the development of advanced monitoring techniques and devices, and the development, manufacturing and testing of innovative isolating and dissipating seismic devices.

Since some tens of years EU countries are trying to mitigate the effects of these events mainly by means of prevention. Scientific progress in natural risk assessment and mitigation has increased the capacity of public administration to cope with high risk deriving from volcanic and hydro-geological events, to use satellites for short term prediction of meteo rological events and floods, to work out, refine and enforce seismic EUROCODE 8. Several research project have been supported by EU Framework Programs. In all these cases risk assessment and managing have been approached individually for each risk typolog y and, often, differently even for a same typology in different countries. The consequence has been that the deliverables produced for different types of hazard are often not comparable and different deliverables for the same hazard types are produced i n different countries. The need of harmonisation of terms and procedures has been stressed out in different EU MEDIN and UN Workshops. The aim of this project is to contribute to harmonise the risk assessment procedures and indicate ways to quantitative evaluation of hazard and risk levels through a two years long programmed series of Workshops, seminars, meetings, formation and educational activities which involve scientists, administrators and insurance experts who have been actively working in risk a ssessment problems in the latest years. Regions of South Italy, Greece and France will be used as test cases. The project is divided into 4 WP, dealing with: (1) Dissemination, comparisons of results and harmonisation, (2) Risk evaluation for land, urba n planning and emergency management, (3) Formation and education (4) Publication of results.

We define a knowledge society as one which contains not just one but a plurality of knowledges, expert and lay. These range from the scientific, economic, administrative, and managerial to local, practical and ecological knowledge, traditional repertoires, trial and error or experientially-based discoveries. We further define sustainable development as a knowledge- based set of practices, within which the expert form of knowledge has been dominant, but to which non-expert forms may make a significant contribution. We seek to identify the dynamics of these different forms of knowledge, and their functioning in relation to economy and society, through case studies in 12 different European countries of rural development projects oriented towards increasing sustainability. From an ecological point of view, rural areas are key areas for the transition to sustainable development. With the sustainability policy switch, rural areas have gained new economic significance in the post-industrial and post-agricultural development phase. This is visible in the manifold reactivations of the countryside as a diversifying, locally based economy encompassing new forms of agriculture (including organic and non-food production), small-scale food-processing, new forms of rural tourism, new forms of managing the complex natural resources which are found in or related to rural areas. These reactivations, their varying social and institutional forms, and their use of different forms of knowledge, will be the subject of case-study research through which this project seeks to contribute to a comparative analysis of the emergence of European knowledge society, and to the provision of a sound knowledge base for policies to manage this transition.

To achieve these objectives we will use a combination of gene expression profiling, bioinformatic analysis, histology of human female breast cancer samples, genetic manipulation of transplantable tumour cells and transgenic mouse technology. In addition to finding new genes, we aim to analyse to what extent genes already known to play a role in breast cancer metastasis specify which organs breast tumours metastasise to. We will also establish how the currently known genes that are associated with breast cancer dissemination and the new ones we identify fit together into pathways that regulate organ- specific metastasis. These findings will be coupled with the analysis of clinical trials that participants in this consortium are involved in. Further deliverables include the development of improved animal models for the study of breast cancer metastasis, and the development of diagnostic methods for determining whether primary tumours already have metastatic potential. Together, the work packages in this proposal will establish a pipeline of activities that unite basic research into the organ-specific metastasis of breast cancer with target validation and clinical application.

Incidence estimates vary from 1/30,000 to 1/100 000. Mutation identification aids early diagnosis. Although there is encouraging single centre experience with copper-chelators (BAL in early work, now penicillamine or trientine), zinc sulfate or acetate, or ammonium tetrathiomolybdate, treatment dilemmas remain. We do not know how to treat pre-symptomatically diagnosed infants. There is a lack of randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs). Initial neurological deterioration on starting treatment may not be reversible. Long term outlook is uncertain. A small survey of clinicians revealed wide differences in treatment choices and lack of certainty about optimum treatment. A Cochrane-style literature review found virtually no Level I evidence. A multicentre stratified RCT is necessary. In 2002 the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition established a working group of paediatric and adult hepatologists and neurologists with representation from the European Society for the Study of the Liver and the Movement Disorder Society. This has concluded that mounting an RCT is not possible without data on the incidence, prevalence of sub-types, current treatments, and short term outcomes. The consortium wishes to establish a European Clinical Database, data from which will inform the process of setting up an RCT. Preliminary work has addressed diagnostic criteria, database items, choice of soft ware, database host, and secure access. The aims of the project are to set up the database, collect and analyse 1 year's data, set up an RCT planning group and workshop, and to continue data collection and patient monitoring for 4 years.

Experience has shown that the availability of biomass could be a serious obstacle for its extensive use for energy. There is a possibility of rendering the use of biomass more viable by blending it with non-toxic wastes, which are economically unattractive for recycling and are expensive to dispose of in landfills. It is, therefore, imperative that there is a satisfactory synergy between coal, biomass and wastes so that the impact of multi-fuel co-firing minimizes any negative aspect of any fuel when used separately. The proposed study aims at determining the limits of the optimised operation that could be beneficial in getting rid of waste and promoting biomass for environmentally acceptable energy generation. The important output of the proposed work could be that biomass and wastes are to be used in co-firing applications, thus enhancing the prospect for wide range of availability of the co-fuel. Larger power stations generally have to use more than one base fuel and one co-fuel because of regular changes in availability and price. This requires that the technical feasibility of co-firing various fuel blends have to be assured. It has still to be demonstrated that certain combinations of biomass and waste could have specific advantages either for the combustor performance, or for the flue gas cleaning or for ash behaviour. The integration of biomass with its whole supply chain into a multihued-based nationwide heat and energy supply system will in the present project be comprehensively investigated for three exemplary countries, namely Portugal and Italy, both EU member states, and Turkey, an EU candidate country. In the future, the management of the intermediate-size power stations will be forced to be involved more with the business of co-firing. Otherwise they will not be able to compete in offering low cost electricity with the large size power stations.

This project will focus on unravelling the cell biology underlying these disorders by identifying the processes that control KCNQ channel function, including their modulation by second messengers, biogenesis, targeting and transcriptional control. We shall identify and characterise the mode of action of new drugs that affect the function of these channels. We will analyse the biochemical and biophysical properties of the mutations associated with these disorders. Structure-function studies will unveil the processes affected, including the trafficking, membrane insertion, assembly (oligomerisation) and degradation of KCNQ channels. The transduction mechanisms underlying their regulation by neurotransmitters will be studied. By exploring protein-protein interactions, the molecular complexes that interact with these channels will be deciphered, and the physiological significance of the interactions identified and validated will be analysed. Because some mutations in the KCNQ loci do not appear to lie in the coding region, and nothing is known about the control of KCNQ gene transcription, we will study how the expression of those genes is regulated. Mouse models for some of the disorders are available for analysis in this project, and further conditional mutants will be produced to gain a more precise idea of the pathology of these diseases. Mutagenesis structure-function studies will also unveil the molecular basis for drug specificity, permitting the mechanisms of action to be defined. We have already found new drugs that modulate KCNQ channels with promising pharmacological potential and we will screen for new compounds using high throughput methods, evaluating their therapeutic potential.
100|grant.3760701|508833; 80149; EGEE|Enabling grids For E-science|Enabling grids For E-science|EGEE (Enabling Grids for E-Science in Europe) aims to integrate current national, regional and thematic computing and data Grids to create a European Grid-empowered infrastructure for the support of the European Research Area, exploiting unique expertise generated by previous EU projects (DataGrid, Crossgrid, DataTAG, etc) and national Grid initiatives (UK e-Science, INFN Grid, Nordugrid, US Trillium, etc).   The EGEE consortium involves 70 leading institutions in 27 countries, federated in regional Grids, with a combined capacity of over 20000 CPUs, the largest international Grid infrastructure ever assembled.  The EGEE vision is to provide distributed European research communities with a common market of computing, offering round-the-clock access to major computing resources, independent of geographic location, building on the EU Research Network Geant and NRNs. EGEE will support common Grid computing needs, integrate the computing infrastructures of these communities and agree on common access policies. The resulting infrastructure will surpass the capabilities of localised clusters and individual supercomputing centres, providing a unique tool for collaborative computer and data intensive e-Science. EGEE will work to provide interoperability with other major Grid initiatives such as the US NSF Cyber infrastructure, establishing a worldwide Grid infrastructure.  EGEE is a two-year project in a four-year programme. Major implementation milestones after two years will provide the basis for assessing subsequent objectives and funding needs. Two pilot applications areas have been selected to guide the implementation and certify the performance of EGEE: the Particle Physics LHC Grid (LCG), where the computing model is based exclusively on a Grid infrastructure to store and analyse petabytes of data from experiments at CERN;

In accompany with special synthetic or natural compounds (redox-mediators) laccase becomes capable of reaction with highly persistent compounds, not normally oxidized by this enzyme. Ligninolytic basidiomycetes (white rot fungi) produce laccases with the highest redox-potential. This suggests that fungal laccase/mediator pair is one of the most powerful oxidants of natural origin, interesting as object of fundamental studies, as well as potential agent for biotechnological applications, already tested for waste waters treatment, transformation of xenobiotics, textile fibres or paper pulp bleaching.   Although laccase is a relatively well-known enzyme, only very recently the crystal structure of a laccase from a wood-rotting basidiomycete fungus has been published. Recently the Russian partner in collaboration with Finnish partner, and the Italian partner found new forms of ""yellow"" and ""white"" fungal laccases, respectively. These enzymes had unusual spectral properties, but these non-blue laccases were active. The yellow forms catalyzed reactions with persistent compounds, normally not oxidized by blue laccases, without addition of mediators.   Aromatic compounds, which were suggested to affect the activity of the enzyme, may originate from the natural lignocellulosics such as straw or wood. These compounds may attach in the enzyme protein and affect spectral properties, and possibly act as mediators for oxidation of polymeric substances like lignin. Unusual enzymes may also have differences in the topology and composition of the copper-binding sites (in particular Cu-I and Cu-II) within the enzyme proteins. They may be caused by differences in the amino acid sequences of the respective laccase variants.   The main objective of this study is to clarify the true nature of new non-blue laccases compared to classic blue enzymes.  The main tasks (with participating partners in parenthesis) of the proposed work are: (i) to determine the species specificity and ecological dependence of laccase in white-rot fungi (mostly by Russian partners using their large fungal culture collections); (ii) to determine the conditions of growth and development of selected white-rot fungal strains for high laccases production and formation of unusual forms of laccases (all partners); (iii) to compare spectral and catalytic properties of blue, yellow and white laccases of white rot fungi (mostly by Russian partner); (iv) to study of structure of laccase genes and proteins to find out the genetic and structural basis for the production of unusual forms of laccases; homology modelling and attempts to crystallize the enzyme protein will be done (mostly by Italian, but also by Finnish and Russian partners); and (v) to study the presence of aromatic substrate compounds on the unusual spectral properties and reactions catalyzed by the enzymes (Russian partner)."

NEWS methods are in various stages of development and have not yet been applied to aircraft health monitoring. The project's goal is to examine, confirm and exploit the successful results of these techniques, using fundamental materials research on fatigue loading, and to apply them to the particular field of aeronautics. The project includes progressive microdamage and fatigue monitoring of aircraft components and structures, sensor engineering, development of NEWS-based imaging methods, and fundamental research on the modelling of meso-scale damage phenomena. We aim to investigate the relation of these studies to the macroscopic behaviour of progressively fatiguing materials, and formulate the design of a unique system for microdamage inspection, including remote control and communication tools, and the completion of a full-scale model demonstration. The long-term goal of the project (5-10 years) is to monitor while in operation, the integrity of airframes and aircraft engines, and helicopter rotor systems. The development of this innovative NEWS-based technology and its engineering applications to aeronautics, will result in an enhanced, reliable and integrated measurement system and protocol for microcrack diagnostics of aircraft components and structures. We expect this development to result in a significant increase in aircraft and passenger safety while contributing to a substantial cost savings through a decrease in maintenance and operating times'.

The reaction environments to be used are shock waves, combustion and detonation processes, plasma jets, and laser plasma flows. Also the development of novel diagnostic tools for these studies are. The development of new technologies for the synthesis of various carbon nanoparticles with specific properties is in the center of attention of the European industry. Therefore, the results of this complex study will be directly used to elaborate new and to improve existing ways for the synthesis of nanotubes, fullerenes, nano-carbynes, nano-sized organic carbon and nano-diamonds. This research combines the expertise of 7 world-leading scientific groups in the field of nano-physics for further development of the advanced technologies of nanomaterials production.  The complex experimental and theoretical study includes the analysis of the formation mechanisms of various condensed carbon structures at different experimental conditions, the elaboration of new kinetic mechanisms of condensation, and serious improvement of the diagnostic tools to monitor nano-size particle formation and growth. In particular, the project envisages the following work to be done: - To develop methods for the determination of the size, structure, and thermodynamic properties of growing nanoparticles in high temperature processes;  - To develop optical methods to monitor nanotubes formation based on dynamic laser speckle technology in real and quasi- real time operation mode; - To determine the kinetics of carbon nanoparticle formation during hydrocarbon pyrolysis and condensation of supersaturated carbon vapor at the high temperatures; - To analyse the mechanisms of nanoparticle formation in non-equilibrium plasma flows generated in high voltage atmospheric pressure discharge; - To further develop the evaporation-condensation method for the production of carbon nanostructures; - To investigate the laser plasma jet dynamics together with the formation of nanostructures and to analyse the size, composition, and phase-structure of the laser prepared nanostructures; - To analyse the features of the detonation waves as the robust tool for carbon particles synthesis;  - To study nano-size organic carbon particles formed in combustion systems.  It is expected that new insights in carbon particles growth at high temperatures will result in practical recommendations for the synthesis of carbon nanoparticles with specific properties. By extending the NIS-INTAS collaboration, significant advances in the fundamental science as well as in applied techniques will be possible. The application of existing techniques to problems of importance for the international community are expected. The participants of the project also expect to expand their industrial contacts to ensure that the results will be of practical importance.
100|grant.3765292|505878; 74363; PIAM|Polymer Injection Advanced Moulding|Polymer Injection Advanced Moulding|"Injection Moulding is one of the main polymer forming process, offering high volumes, high precision and high added values. Polymer parts are used for large consumption applications (automotive industry, domestic and electric applications, toys...) but also for sophisticated high technology products (electronic devices, biomedical implants, lenses, optic fibres connectors, DVD...). Part dimensions range from very large size (automotive dashboards) to very small ones (micromechanics, electronic components...). Polymer converters are numerous (and relatively scattered) in Europe, close to 30000 companies, often SME, involving over one million employees. In ""classical"" injection moulding, there are increasing demands for process control, dimensional stability and properties insurance. More demanding are ""emerging technologies"" such as micro products or large size parts but with surface reproduction at the micro scale. Strong limitations remain due to a lack of knowledge of the physics of these small-scale non-equilibrium processes. Only a combined effort of advanced numerical and experimental expertise will allow significant improvements in these two domains. The Pam Coordination Action Proposal aims at initiating a wide consortium of European experts involved in all aspects of the injection moulding process (processing, material science, physical and numerical modelling, mechanical properties...). These experts belong to academic and industrial research centres, but also to technological research centres, which are closely connected, to SME. Putting together this wide range of expertise will result in setting the basis for the development of a new generation of predictive tools for polymer injection moulding accounting for the more achieved physical models and numerical techniques. Such tools should contribute in lowering the cost, improving the quality and enlarge the domain of application of injection-moulded parts."

Although most epilepsies are idiopathic, meaning that they do not recognize a specific triggering mechanism or hereditary transmission, about 1-2% of epilepsies are genetically-determined. Within these hereditary forms, Benign Neonatal Familial Convulsions (BNFC) have a typical onset in the first week of postnatal life that end spontaneously by the age of six months, without affecting the neurological or psychological development of the affected child.The present research project will serve a double purpose. On one hand, it will provide clinically-relevant information on the disease, by identifying novel mutations in the affected genes and by establishing correlation between the severity of the disease and the underlying genetic alteration. On the other hand, by means of an integrated approach of different basic science methodologies, the functional consequences of such genetic alterations will be defined, with particular focus on the functional alterations (biophysical, pharmacological, and biochemical) they induce on the activity of the cellular systems where malfunctioning genes are implicated.It seems possible to foresee that the achievement of the proposed aims, will provide momentum to the improvement of the clinical and basic science knowledge about the pathogenesis, the pathophysiology and the pharmacology of BFNC. Furthermore, it seems likely that the results achieved will be of interest not only to those patients affected by BFNC, but also impact on the large population of patients suffering from idiopathic epilepsy, for whom optimal pharmacological treatments are still missing.
100|grant.3769090|502865; 72808; SEFA|Sound Engineering For Aircraft (SEFA)|Sound Engineering For Aircraft (SEFA)|The aim of SEFA is to develop technology design criteria (Sound Engineering) based on a thorough assessment of which characteristics would make aircraft more acceptable for airport communities from a noise signature standpoint (spectral and directivity shapes, impact of separation time, ...), addressing from a complementary perspective the concerns of close communities (peak periods of activities with short separation time), distant ones (high altitude traffic with low background noise) and disturbance from night operations. As of now, such criteria do not exist and so far, aircraft noise engineering has focused on achieving ever lower noise levels for individual events and at close distance from the runway. The project objectives are consistent with the Framework 6 workprogramme on Aeronautics and Space, promoting open upstream research for reduction of noise at source as well as improved understanding of the impact of aircraft noise in the community. Thanks to its technical scope and workplan, SEFA is aimed at addressing both aspects and has the ambitious goal of improving the relationship between the technology optimisation process and how the resulting aircraft sound is perceived. Through improved optimisation of noise reduction concepts, SEFA will have a significant strategic impact in reinforcing the competitiveness of the European Industry while addressing the long term Vision 2020 environmental goals. A novel approach, based on Sound Quality engineering practices, will be used to define optimum aircraft community noise shapes. These targets for aircraft sound optimisation will be validated by psychometric testing. To support the definition of design criteria able to meet these target sounds, innovative simulation tools (virtual aircraft and virtual resident) will be developed to allow the identification of relevant physical parameters which impact the noise that can be heard at the resident location.

Major goal is to develop a new, cost effective bio-manufacturing process for the production of a smart, innovative product, tailored for the specific needs of footwear manufacturers, to be used as raw material by tanneries, that will guarantee: controlled biochemical composition, standard and consistent quality, process yield increase, substitution of chemical with high tech biological processes, 50 - 60% reduction in water consumption and in pollution loads. The complexity and strategic importance of the problem is a challenge that cannot be addressed by single SMEs; therefore the project complies with the objectives and falls within the scope of application of Collective Research. Expertise from two Universities and three sectorial research institutions, as well as Bioreactor and Tannery Machines developers will be amalgamated with eight SMEs technical skills, under the leadership of six lAGs. Starting from the product specification definition, attained with the participation of all industrial partners, tissue engineering techniques used for biomedical applications will be transferred, adapted, optimised and validated.  The stepwise research approach comprises design, development and testing of cells, materials, protocols and bioreactors. The project is expected to yield demonstrators tested at lab and pilot scale, including bioreactors, matrices, culturing protocols and a stabilisation system as well as a waste treatment / recycling system, towards a closed loop production approach. Moreover, industrial feasibility of Dermagenesis will be assessed in conjunction to fitness for end use of Bio techno leather (model shoes). In parallel, training of skilled personnel and the definition and exploration of exploitation pathways, will involve directly SMEs and lAGs.

This is in part due to the lack of available efficacious trol methods, to the ban of some chemicals, and to the prohibition of their use in organic farming. The use of biotrol agents, although is widely sidered a very promising strategy of disease and weed management at the soil level, has still a limited application at the European level, due to the limited efficacy of the microbes and to the lack of knowledge for their best use. The main aim of the project is to study some of the already available or the most promising biotrol microorganisms (such as Fusarium, Trichoderma or iothyrium sp.), using a combination of strategies. Studying the genetic and physiological enhancement strategies, the ecological fitness of the agents, the production, formulation and application methods, the integration with other organisms and with trol methods, and assessing their quality and the risk of release into the environment, it will be possible to improve the efficacy of fungal biotrol agents, allowing their wider use at the European level, and giving new important tools to support the production of safer and healthier foods.

In the past ten years the methodologies used in those fields have dramatically converged due to the massive use of numerical methods. Modern Computational techniques in combination with parallel computer architectures allow the simulation of the complete three-dimensional phenomena of wave propagation for realistic complex structures with unprecedented detail. This suggests that the reverse processes ( e.g. imaging of the Earth's internal structure, physical description of hydrocarbon reservoirs, monitoring of zones of weakness in constructions, characterization of earthquake rupture processes, etc.) will experience a quantum jump in resolution and accuracy over the next decade.The SPICE network aims at integrating institutions with specialisations in physical, mathematical, geological, and computational aspects of wave propagation. The goal is to develop, verify and apply computational tools for wave propagation and imaging problems on all scales. With the novel computational algorithms we expect breakthroughs in (1) the determination of global Earth structure; (2) the quantitative estimation of shaking hazard; (3) the characterization and monitaoring of reservoirs; (4) understanding the structure and processes inside volcanoes; (5) simulating the physical processes of earthquake rupture; and (6) characterizing the small-scale properties of rocks.Computational methodologies play an increasingly important role in Earth Sciences. However, the curricula are not able to provide the required teaching to equip young scientists with the necessary background in mathematical and computational aspects of a rapidly expanding field. The goal of the proposed network is to compensate for this and to provide open training facilities for the next...

As these diseases progress, all but the most primitive functions of the nervous system are lost due to the degeneration and subsequent death of nerve cells. Eventually patients die in a state of incapacitation. Only a small fraction of cases can be accounted for by gene mutations. Altogether, the underlying aetiologies are poorly understood. A hallmark common to these neurodegenerative disorders is the deposition of abnormal protein aggregates. There is currently no treatment available that can halt or prevent, let alone reverse nerve cell degeneration. The APOPIS project is designed to apply the unique information provided by sequencing of the human genome to further the understanding of and to develop treatments for these deva¬ stating diseases. By integrating Europe's leading research centres in clinical research, human genetics, cell biology, genomics, proteomics and bioinformatics, the VERUM Foundation has devised a consortium to identify genes involved, determine their biological functions, establish their role in the patho-physiological processes and identify novel avenues for early diagnosis, treatment and prevention. The chosen approach is based on human population genetics complemented by the identification of modifier genes in model organisms that express both wildtype and mutant variants of known disease-related genes. The consortium meets the prerequisites for such a project: ground breaking research in functional genomics related to human health, creating synergies with and between national research efforts, teaming up with both small biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for the development of diagnostic tools and new drugs, and providing training and mobility to improve the skills of...

Chronic diseases and Drug addiction are among the most severe human problems, the latter being a major motive of crime and social instability. The continuous and endless efforts required from treating personnel and the afflicted persons further compromise the quality of life and give rise to severe compliance problems with therapy. In addition, limited effectiveness and adverse side effects are the result of the currently used medication administration methods. The proposed project IntelliDrug is aimed at obviating these problems.  The proposed innovation will be reached by developing an intra-oral micro-system, which contains a medication replacement reservoir and releases the medication in a controlled, intelligent manner according to the patient needs, in periods lasting days, weeks or months. The device will be reloaded in a simple non-invasive way. The micro-system comprises a medication release mechanism, a built-in intelligence, micro-sensors and micro-actuators, and a remote control. This project explores the application potential of micro-nano technology and investigates the integration technologies required to establish the nano to macro interface and to have ""nano"" interact with the ambient. IntelliDrug deals with research and development of key technologies, such as biosensors and secure communication, low volume controlled drug handling, and the component integration into wearable systems, to manage health status.  The resulting micro-system will help afflicted persons to put an end to their personal misery, to run a life as close as possible to normal and even to turn into a productive member of our society. It also will contribute to strengthen European research, cooperation and industry."

Since molecular and genetic characterisation of Drosophila mfl mutants has concretely anticipated the results only recently obtained in DKC1 mutant mice, we believe that further characterization of the Drosophila gene might speed the understanding of the molecular basis of the DC disease. Specifically, we will perform a set of experiments focused to characterise the bulk of alternative products derived from the mfl gene, whose structure currently appears to be much more complex than previously suspected.Our experiments will be focused on the study of an alternative product of the gene that accumulates specifically in females and is maternally provided to the developing embryos. The functional relevance of this product is outlined by the observation that a product of similar size and expression profile is produced also by human and mice DKC1 genes. Since in adults this product is not expressed ubiquitously, its structure may help to understand why the damages observed in DC patients are essentially restricted to only certain tissues. Moreover, on the light of notion that only 50% of mutations present in DC patients lie within the DKC1 product so far characterised, there is a likehood that some mutations may map within this alternative product, whose structure is so far unknown.

Clinical distinction among these syndromes is sustained by both the occurrence of unique characteristics and the different degree of expressivity. For instance, in EEC patients the extensive ectodermal dysplasia is associated with ectrodactyly while AEC patients do not show limb defects but have fused eyelids, cleft lip/palate and severe scalp dermatitis. The p63 gene encodes a transcription factor, it has a very complex pattern of expression giving raise to at least six different proteins with widely different activities. All six different proteins share a DNA binding domain but only two of them (the p63alpha isoforms) possess a sterile alpha motif (SAM), an evolutionary conserved domain which characterize proteins involved in developmental processes. Mutational analysis on the p63 gene from EEC and AEC patients revealed that the majority of EEC mutations are in residues predicted to contact DNA while AEC mutations are all located in the SAM domain. At present, the knowledge of the mechanisms through which individual p63 proteins modulate ephitelial differentiation is still rudimentary. We will use molecular, cellular and bioinformatic approaches in order to shed light on the different outcomes of p63 molecular lesions in human hereditary skin pathologies. Moreover we will focus on the identification of proteins which physically interact with the p63 SAM domain, where AEC mutations are clustered, to investigate their importance in AEC syndrome. We expect our studies to shed light on cellular pathways in which p63 proteins are involved and to be helpful in devising strategies for therapies that alleviate symptoms of human hereditary skin pathologies.

Whereas an aberrant resistance to apoptosis participates in the development of cancer, excessive cell death, contributes to neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s disease. Mitochondria, essential cellular components responsible for converting the energy in food into fuel for the cells, have been recently found to be key regulators of cell death. Our research focuses on understanding how mitochondria regulate cell death and how this process can be impaired in cancer cells. Additionally, given that we have established a link between specific mitochondrial proteins and Parkinson’s disease, we are interested in determining how defects in these proteins contribute to this neurodegenerative disease. Parkinson’s disease occurs when certain nerve cells, or neurons, in an area of the brain known as the substantia nigra become impaired or die. These neurons normally produce a chemical messenger called dopamine, which is responsible for transmitting signals that ensure smooth, purposeful muscle activity. The loss of dopamine causes the nerve cells to fire out of control, preventing patients from directing or controlling their movements in a normal manner. Some toxic substances in the environment, as well as some illicit drugs can affect mitochondrial function giving rise to parkinsonism in some individuals. We believe that our research might provide links between susceptibility to toxic agents that contribute to Parkinson’s disease and mutations in some of the proteins we are characterizing.  Technical Summary The focus of our research is to better understand the control of cellular death processes in normal cells and in pathological states with alterations of these processes. Our aim is to achieve a better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms controlling cell death. Understanding the basic biology of these processes can provide insights that are aimed to deliver field-changing mechanistic insights into toxicology and disease. Part of our research addresses the function of mitochondrial proteins such as the protease HtrA2 and PINK1 and their role in stress responses. Mutations in HtrA2 and PINK1 are linked to Parkinson’s disease and we identified a mitochondrial stress-sensing pathway that involves the interaction between these two proteins. Our work focuses on mitochondrial signaling pathways of toxicity associated with neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this work is to target these pathways to improve neuronal health in models of Parkinson’s disease and other diseases related to mitochondrial dysfunction. We use the fruit fly as a model system to study organs and tissues with high energetic demand, such as the brain and muscles, that are susceptible to toxic insults.
100|grant.2764234|MC_U117574558|Molecular recognition in post-transcriptional regulation|Molecular recognition in post-transcriptional regulation|The functioning of the human body and of complex organisms in general requires different proteins to be produced in different types of cells. This cell-type-specific protein production is achieved by precisely regulating the translation of the genetic code into proteins. The two steps in this process of translation are, first, the translation of the DNA-encoded information into RNA and, then, the translation of the RNA code into a protein molecule. Both processes are regulated by biological machines, which are composed of proteins and, in some cases, RNA molecules. We focus on the regulation of the RNA-to-protein step (or post-transcriptional regulation) and investigate how the protein RNA machines assemble in a solution environment and regulate gene expression. Our structural studies complement other techniques such as X-ray crystallography, which can be used to study molecules in a static crystalline state. Analysing the structures of the molecules that govern regulation of protein synthesis has a direct medical relevance, as this process lies at the basis of common genetic diseases, cancer and viral infections. We work on an important regulatory mechanism, called ARE mediated mRNA decay (AMD), that increase the synthesis of specific proteins in inflammation and healing processes. This mechanism, if permanently switched on, can lead to inflammatory arthritis and cancer. We want to understand how the switch works at the molecular level and design specific therapies to switch in off when required.--Using a similar technical approach we are also investigating a key regulatory protein from herpes virus. This project wants to facilitate the design of anti-herpes drugs to treat people infected with this virus, which forms a major threat to immunodepressed patients, increases the risk of organ transplantation and chemotherapy and reduces the life expectancy of AIDS sufferers. Molecular insight into the interaction of ICP27 with its functional binding partners needs to be obtained if we are, for example, to design or optimise compounds to lock protein and RNA in a non-functional conformation or to (de)stabilise protein RNA complexes.  Technical Summary Multifunctional eukaryotic regulatory proteins and their viral functional equivalents control gene expression by interacting with mRNAs in large macromolecular aggregates. Dissection of the molecular basis of post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms has a direct medical relevance, as changes in the regulation of mRNA metabolism lie at the basis of common genetic diseases, cancer and viral infection. Current therapies for these diseases do not focus on the post-transcriptional steps of regulation but rather on the transcriptional ones, that are better understood. Our aim is to clarify the structure-function relation that is at the basis of mRNA recognition by post-transcriptional regulatory proteins and to suggest strategies to control this recognition. --Adenine-uracil-rich element (ARE)-mediated mRNA decay (AMD) regulates the concentration of mRNAs that contain AREs within their 3 untranslated regions (3 UTRs) by promoting their degradation. Transient AMD shut-off up-regulates the stability of these mRNAs and is important for processes that require a fast response of the organism such as cellular growth, immune response, cardiovascular toning and external stress-mediated pathways. However, impaired AMD and the consequent pathological long-term increase in the stability of a subset of mRNAs have been related to several types of cancer (skin tumours, colorectal cancer, Hodgkins lymphoma, lung carcinoma and leukaemia) and auto-inflammatory diseases (Crohn-like inflammatory bowel disease and inflammatory arthritis). K-homology splicing regulator protein (KSRP) is an important player in AMD that interacts with several different AREs mediating the degradation of the corresponding mRNAs. Our work centers on the analysis of the structural and functional elements that contribute to KSRP-RNA interactions and to mRNA degradation. We are studying the structure and dynamics of the different domains of the protein and investigated their relationship to mRNA degradation. Using structural and functional information, we plan to dissect the details of the interaction with the RNA and help the design of a strategy for the tuning of KSRP activity.--Herpes viridae induced infections are a major threat to immunodepressed patients, increasing the risk of transplants and chemotherapy and reducing the life expectancy of AIDS sufferers. Current herpes virus therapies (e.g. Acyclovir) aim to block the synthesis of new DNA, but resistance to these treatments is increasing.--Successful viral replication is achieved through the tightly regulated expression of viral genes. A key component of the regulatory mechanism is ICP27, an essential HSV-1 RNA binding protein that regulates protein expression, both at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. We will study both ICP27 and the mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation acted upon by this protein, in particular 3 mRNA editing. Using the same strategy described above for the protein KSRP, we will obtain a better understanding of the regulatory cycle of the virus and define specific structural features amenable to structure-aided drug design

The fate of the TSE agent in soils depends on the balance between retention, destruction and dissemination factors, either biotic or abiotic. Physico-chemical mechanisms of prion adsorption to soil mineral colloids or organo-mineral complexes and desorption conditions will be analysed with respect to protein structural entity and modifications of infectivity at both laboratory and field scales. Soil microrganisms presenting TSE infectivity lytic activity, earthworm gut enzymes as well as necrophagous insect larvae will be considered as main biotic agents affecting infectivity, dissemination and persistency. Recommendations will be deduced from scientific results by the end users associated to the consortium.

These constitute a big environmental problem for all Mediterranean Countries, in terms of pollution and of water consumption. The latter can be particularly relevant, due to the milling techniques adopted by the South-Bank olive-oil producers. New, low cost technologies are developed for minimizing the phenol content of OMW via widely available natural catalysts(olive husk, soil components, white rot fungi). The validation of the results will be afforded by fertirrigation tests. New technologies are developed for the extraction of high added-value compounds from OMW, of potential interest as antioxidant food-additives. All the relevant biological and analytical protocols for the evaluation of the antioxidant activity will be implemented, as well. All technologies will be developed up to pilot scale.
100|grant.3757568|ENK5-CT-2002-00675; 67146; DE-TAR|Degradation of tarwater from biomass gasification (DE-TAR)|Degradation of tarwater from biomass gasification (DE-TAR)|The application of producer gas from biomass gasification for power generation through engines requires cleaning and conditioning. Wet scrubbing is often chosen to remove organic components (tars) and particulate matter and to cool the gas, resulting in the production of contaminated water. On the other hand, even for dry gas cleaning technologies, cooling still produces contaminated liquids. The serious environmental problems posed by such effluents can be faced only by adequate pre-treatments before discharge into urban network. The proposal is concerned with the development and optimisation of a technology for the purification of contaminated water from biomass gasification, which also allows energy to be recovered from the tarry pollutants. Currently, these are separated into a heavy fraction, not soluble in water and recycled back to the gasifier, and a light fraction, soluble in water that needs treatment. The treatment technology is based on supercritical wet oxidation/gasification (SCWO/G). The R&D activities proposed include experimentation at laboratory and pilot scale and mathematical modelling, both supporting evaluations for full scale (technical and economic) implementation .The overall objective is to evaluate the full scale application of supercritical wet oxidation/gasification (SCWO/G). Indeed liquid effluents from biomass gasification plants are too dilute to incinerate and yet too toxic to bio-treatment. The process under study refers to the aqueous oxidation/gasification of organic (and inorganic) materials at pressure and temperatures above the critical data for water. More specific objectives are: 1. to characterise the chemical composition of waste water from updraft gasification of wood (in particular, light tar components which are soluble in water), 2. to apply and optimise SCWO/G of such waste water at laboratory and pilot scale, 3.to formulate kinetic and transport models for the SCWO/G process including validation and process simulation, 4. to provide a chemical characterisation of the effluent water from the SCWO/G process, 5. to extend the results of the analysis carried out for the effluents (of a wet gas cleaning process) from a 6 MWTH updraft wood-chips plant to other gasifier configurations and other gas cleaning technologies, based on literature information, 6. to provide a full scale evaluation of the process for both the technical (energetic and environmental) and the economic aspects. The project will be carried out on 3 different levels: 1. The Laboratory Scale Unit (LSU - already existing 1 kg/h system, financed exclusively by some of the Partners) will be used to establish parameters for the thermo chemical mechanisms involved under various process conditions (retention times, temperature/pressure levels and influence of raw tar-water acidity and added carbon powder catalyst). 2. The Process Development Unit (PDU - which is in the process of being designed for a capacity of 60 kg/h, financed in part by a national Energy Agency) will be used for correlation with the mathematical model and tools to be developed, for optimisation of the SCWO/G processes and as a basis for up-scaling the process for full scale application. 3. A full-scale implementation layout (1000 kg/h of waste water), which will be used to evaluate the capital/operational cost and environmental impact of the technology.

This allowed improved diagnostic procedures, notably in the prenatal period, and helped take steps towards specific treatments. The vast majority of genetic disorders, however, are rare and frequently misdiagnosed. The objective of this project is to elucidatethe genomic bases and to facilitate the diagnosis and rationalise the treatment of the leaky red cell syndromes (LRC). These diseases include the hereditary stomatocytosis and allied disorders which are characterized by an abnormal permeability of the red cell membrane to univalentcations Na and K.Stomatocytes are red blood cells having a slit-like central zone of pallor on dried smears. This shape abnormality appears related to the intracellular concentration of monovalent cations that is critical for the maintenance of erythrocyte deformability. A net increase in Na and K causes water enter, forming stomatocytes or hydrocytes, whereas a net loss of monovalent cations produces dehydrated red cells or xerocytes. These disorders are inherited as an autosomal dominant pattern and are more heterogeneous than previously thought. For example dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis includes kindreds showing pseudohyperkalemia or perinatal edema, or both; the overhydrated hereditary stomatocytosis remainds elusive despite the manifest lack of the enigmatic protein stomatin in the erythrocyte membrane.In all cases were splenectomy has been performed, this procedure has conferred a marked risck for thrombosis in adult life.The aims of our project are:1) identification of the responsible genes and proteins of LCR sindromes;2) understanding of the pathophysiology at the cellular and molecular level;3) improving in diagnosis and treatment.

The most serious hazards are represented by the occurrence of pyroclastic flows and tephra fallout at European cities on explosive volcanoes and volcanic islands. Whatever the policy to mitigate such a huge risk might be, quantification of risk in association with a range of eruption scenarios, their impact, and mitigation are the fundamental priorities. This project addresses these critical issues by advancing critical scientific and technological facilities (i.e. the infrastructures), needed in volcanic risk assessment and mitigation, such as the computer models to simulate the process dynamics, the vulnerability databases, and the probabilistic risk assessment protocol. The project also aims to apply these facilities to those European volcanoes at high risk Vesuvius, Soufriere, Sete Cidades, Teide) so that they become a technology platform for exploitation at volcanoes throughout the world capable of supporting officials in deciding development and planning priorities as well as decision making in volcanic crises.

In Computational Logic, the new paradigm of Answer Set Programming (ASP) promises to help the specification and solution of problems that need both reasoning by cases and reasoning under incomplete information. Robust and reasonably scalable implementations are now available. This Working Group will enable a systematic exchange of information among the implementation teams and test users, foster synergies in research efforts and achieve a critical mass of researchers on pilot applications.  OBJECTIVES Research efforts, both in theory and implementation of Answer Set Programming have hitherto proceeded somewhat in parallel among European Universities. To bring ASP to the next level, i.e., to programmability by non-experts and usage in industrial-strength applications, requires an effort to bring together researchers and potential users, identify and concentrate on the most promising applications as well as on the more relevant remaining theoretical problems. The aim of the Working Group is to foster synergies among teams that so far have been working on competing implementations and diverse application areas.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK The Working Group will organise a series of workshops, including the second ASP workshop (following the ASP symposium in Stanford, 2001) dedicated to communication of results and a web site will be constructed to describe the research, the distribution ASP solvers worldwide, an application showcase and bibliographies and publications for students and researchers. The exchange of PhD students is one of the main goals and will be supported. Some of the deliverables are: i) a benchmark suite for evaluating (and comparing) progress in ASP solvers implementation; ii) collect and organize reports of successful applications in industry; iii) some standardisation of the input language for ASP solvers and iv) a class syllabus for Artificial Intelligence that is based on learning and applying ASP solvers.

The research will tackle head on two fundamental fields of research and applications in this area. First that smooth numerical methods fail on nonsmooth complementarity systems. Algorithms need to be developed that deal with hit crossings, impacts, complementarity problems, sliding and chatter in a robust and applicable way. Second, the qualitative understanding of the dynamics including the design of feedback and robust control algorithms requires specific methods and cannot be solved with simple adaptations of known techniques for smooth linear or nonlinear dynamical systems.  OBJECTIVES The strategic aim of this project is the development of novel algorithms and numerical routines for the qualitative analysis, simulation and feedback control of nonsmooth complementarity dynamical systems. The output of this project will be an integrated numerical software package for the virtual prototyping of systems with discontinuities and development of novel control techniques for this class of dynamical systems. This will be achieved through an in-depth investigation of the mathematical and engineering open problems related to nonsmooth complementarily systems. Therefore, this project is clearly focused on the development over 4 years of a user friendly, versatile and computational.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK The proposed research needed to achieve the objectives of the project will proceed in 7 concurrent workpackages reflecting the fact that, a lot of detail work has to be performed integrating existing results with new derivations to overcome the existing restrictions. In particular, research and development on the following key-areas will be carried out: mathematical analysis; development of numerical methods and software implementation; modeling and formalisation of the dynamics; bifurcation analysis and classification; stabilisation and control of, trajectories; applications to mechatronics and automotive systems. All through the project emphasis will be given to the activities required for the efficient management of the project and the effective dissemination and exploitation of results. The participating teams already possess a strong experience in the theoretical and numerical analysis of nonsmooth dynamical systems. This will allow the achievement of the ultimate target of the project, i.e. a user friendly, versatile and computationally effective numerical tool for complementarity dynamical systems. The validation and testing of this tool will be carried out in collaboration with the support of a group of industries which has shown a deep interest in the project scientific areas and its outcome. The management of the grant will be run like an advanced TMR network, the management of which we consider to be a workpackage in its own right with a scientific sub-coordinator. In addition, each participating team will have a representative who is responsible for the coordination of the activities at that centre.

Some of these are due to alterations in genes that play a fundamental role in human development. Therefore, such alterations cause prenatal mortality and as a consequence it is very difficult to obtain biological samples to study. The aim of this project is to collect and to store biological materials (cells and DNA) derived from malformed fetuses. This material will be screened by cytogenetics analysis in order to identify those cases in which, also by the use of molecular genetics technology such as “microchips arrays”, it is possible to identify and functionally analyze genes responsible for the defect. It is expected that alterations in some of these genes, other than a role in congenital malformations, might have a role in adult life pathologies.

The technology is based on an automatic, remote controllable, self-correcting, electronic saliva-stimulating system residing in a dental implant. This leading-edge technology will restore salivation by constantly monitoring (micro-sensors) oral parameters and by automatic, medication-free, correction. It will comprise micro-sensors, micro actuators, software and an intuitive - but controllable - interactive interface. The system's proper functioning and safety will be validated in elderly patients from several European communities, to assess the overall impact on their rehabilitation, quality of life and social interaction.  Objectives: The objectives are to: a. Develop an effective and adverse side-effect free, electro-stimulation based therapy for dry-mouth in elderly patients; b. Identify most suitable parameters for salivary gland nerves stimulation; c. Investigate suitable micro-sensoring methods to identify required stimulation timing and levels; d. Identify special physiological and other requirements of the ageing population regarding xerostomia, and the unique functional adjustments to be incorporated into the Saliwell technology; e. Design and produce a fully functional intelligent miniaturised prototype device (tooth crown sized) fitting the needs of the ageing population and conforming to European specifications and regulations; f. Disseminate the know-how generated to European dental professionals and to the aged citizens to promote exploitation of the technology.  Work description: To identify optimal parameters for stimulation of salivation, and the proper methodology for sensing the need for it, a preliminary mountable device with external electronics will be tried in volunteers. Once these variables are defined, and safety and biocompatibility of the device is checked, a miniaturised, implant supported prototype (comprising micro-sensors, micro-actuators, software, a controllable but intuitive interactive interface, a tiny long-life battery and a communication system) for evaluation in various groups of aged Europeans from different countries will be designed, constructed and tested on animals and human volunteers. A programmable algorithm for maintaining and modifying the sequence of stimulation, by remote control, will be developed. The prototype will be tested in mostly elderly individuals with ""dry-mouth"" syndrome. This will enable to adjust the technology for the targeted population and gather user acceptance and recommendations. The findings and methodology of this innovative technology will be distributed throughout European professional groups, and disseminated to associations of elderly citizens and to various organs that care for the aged. European manufacturers will define technological and engineering parameters to facilitate speedy exploitation of the technology.  Milestones: The major milestones of the project are: M2.1 - M2.6 - completion of specifications, protocols & methodology - month 3; M3.2 - completion of very low power, miniature sensing device, first prototype - month 10; M 4 - fully functional software - month 12; M6 - completion of personal remote controller and electro-stimulator - month 16; M9.1 - completion of 100 prototype specimens - month 26; M10.1 - completion of final prototype specimens - month 29."

The research field deals with the functional characterization of miniaturized metalloproteins. Miniaturized metalloproteins are peptide based synthetic models of natural macromolecular systems. Peptide models stand at the crossroads of small molecule models and large proteins. Their structures are simple, and hence more easily understood than their natural counterparts. They simultaneously have sufficient size and chemical diversity to allow the construction of functional, binding and catalytic sites. The Bioinorganic Chemistry Group in Naples reached important results in the design, synthesis and characterization of three miniaturized metallo-protein systems: 1) hemo-protein models; 2) diiron protein models; 3) iron-sulfur protein models. The post-doctorate fellows will carry out measurements of the catalytic activity of the miniaturized metalloproteins. Fellows will carry out a systematic analysis of the effects of the peptide matrix in modulating the properties and the reactivity of the metal centre, such as recognition of specific substrates, regio- and chemio-selectivity. The rates, extents and turnover numbers will be correlated with the physical and structural properties of the protein, including the solvent accessibility of the active site, the presence of second-shell hydrogen bonds, and the redox potential of the ions. The fellows will be responsible for the selection of the proper assays, which will be chosen depending on the system to be tested. Applicants should have a first degree in chemistry or equivalent ability, a PhD or a good experience in bio-inorganic chemistry, and in enzyme catalysis.

Indeed, loss of p53 function in cancer is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy. Moreover, this family of transcription factors play a key role in development of central nervous system, epidermal tissue and in overall organism metabolism. Using genetically modified mouse model and high throughput analysis, we aim to understand: 1) How these transcription factors mediate chemo sensitivity, 2) How they regulate organismal development and physiology.  Technical Summary The scope of the Apoptosis & Cancer Laboratory is to understand the fundamental mechanisms of cell death (apoptosis) and tissue response to injury caused by drugs, chemicals and endogenous molecules, like free radicals. In particular, we study the physiological functions of the p53 family proteins (namely p53, p63 and p73) and their involvement in tumorigenesis and neurodegeneration triggered by toxic insults. We make use of multiple scientific approaches ranging from systems biology (proteomic and genomic screenings) to the generation and characterization of genetically modified mouse models.  We are also interested to the development of chemical compounds that can regulate expression and function of these transcription factors, and that could therefore have potential therapeutic applications.   Objectives Alterations of proteins that control cell proliferation, cell survival and cell death are the main causes of diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders and dictate the efficacy of drug treatment. The protein members of the p53 family, composed of TP63, TP73 and TP53 itself, are transcription factors that, by binding to the DNA, modulate the expression of multiple genes that play pivotal functions in the regulation of proliferation, differentiation, cell death, stem cell renewal and cell fate commitment. While p53 has been extensively studied over the last 32 years, p73 biology is still lagging behind despite lying at the crossroads between differentiation, cell cycle control and cell death.   We aim to understand the mechanisms of p73 regulation during toxic insults and to define how it influences the outcome and severity of cellular and organism response to toxic insults. To this end, we are investigating several aspect of the p53-family biology, including:  1- p73 function in DNA damage response and cancer therapy,  2- Characterization of in vivo DNA damage models & large-scale transcriptional analysis,  3- p73, metabolism and ageing,  4- Neuronal implications of p73 deficiency,  5-Bioinformatic Evaluation of predictive value of p53 family in cancer progression and chemosensitivity in collaboration with Alexej Antonov (MRC Toxicology Unit), 6- MicroRNA and the p53 family in cancer progression in collaboration with Martin Bushell (MRC Toxicology Unit), 7- The deregulation of translation, in collaboration with Anne E.

The type of protein, the involved tissue and the timing of cellular toxicity create various diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, spongiform encephalopathy and several hereditary amyloidoses. Our project is focused on the mechanism of amyloid formation caused by variants of apolipoprotein A1(apoA1): the lipoprotein that normally remove the excess of cholesterol. Our group (http://www.amiloidosi.it/) has shown that apoA1 variants are responsible for two types of hereditary amyloidosis in Italy (Obici et al 1999-Mangione et al 2001). In these cases we have made two original discoveries: 1) The pathogenic part of the protein corresponds to 93 N-terminal residues. 2) In the high density lipoproteins of our heterozygous patients (who have 50% normal DNA and 50% mutated DNA) 75% of the apoA1 is normal and 25% is mutated. We, therefore, have two aims: 1) elucidation of the conditions that cause the release of the toxic part of the protein (the N-terminus of the 93 residues) and elucidation of the mechanism of fibril formation; 2) understanding of the biochemical basis of the excess of normal protein in HDL. The two targets of the research have therapeutic implications: 1) the way which the 93 residue N-terminal domain is released could represent a therapeutic target (i.e. the use of anti-proteases). The unbalanced level of circulating wild type apoA1 suggests that two possible mechanisms are involved: faster degradation and/or faster deposition into amyloid fibrils. We believe that the two phenomena might possibly coexist and that understanding their mechanisms would help in designing therapies aimed at increasing the degradation rather than the formation of fibrils.

The aim for the PV module cost is < 1 Euro/Wp by 2010, helping to reach the White Paper target of 3 GWp capacity by 2010. These issues are addressed by the objectives of this proposal. The basic project aim is a significant reduction of the manufacturing cost/Wp by the development of innovative cell structures and related fast (>1dm²/3s) low-stress manufacturing technologies suitable for thin (200 micrometer) EFG Si sheets and multicrystalline Si wafers, leading to efficiencies of 15.0% (EFG) and 16.5% (multi-Si) and a reduction of expensive Si-feedstock consumption to values below 4 gr. Si/Wp. The feasibility of cost reduction has to be validated at the end of the project by verification of the assumptions in the MUSIC -FM study (CT94 0008). Work performed: In parallel three alternative texturing processes have been developed. Two of these processes result in an isotropically textured surface. These processes rely on acidic etching solutions. The first texturing process is only suited for multicrystalline wafers that are diced from an ingot because the etching mechanism relies on the saw damage from wafer dicing. Because this process is not suited for EFG Si wafers (no saw damage present) another chemical solution has been developed for EFG wafers. A third texturing technology is based on an alkaline texturing set-up that applies a high cathodic potential by attaching an electrode to the wafer. Thus short-etching times can be achieved and the regime of alkaline etching can be varied in a wide range. While the first two technologies have been successfully applied to the production of solar cells, the third alternative is still on a more fundamental level. Textured surfaces are one of the key features that are required to successfully produce highly efficient solar cells on thin wafers. A wet bench that is suited for isotexturing and pre-diffusion cleaning has been designed and is currently manufactured within the project. Diffusion processes for shallow homogeneous emitters have been developed and optimised resulting reproducibly on target sheet resistance values of about 60 ohm/sq. Alternative attempts to develop selective emitter processes require still more effort in the development of adequate P pastes and the respective processes. Therefore, P pastes have been developed and investigated. These pastes are developed for resulting in respective target emitter sheet resistance values and P surface concentrations when applied in the same optimised diffusion process. Issues like possible Fe contamination and diffusion glass removal after diffusion had to be analysed in more detail. A shallower light receiving emitter region is important if thinner solar cells are to produce high conversion efficiencies. A novel edge isolation mechanism to locally interrupt a parasitic diffusion area at the rear side has been developed. This concept is based on a KOH containing paste that should be applied by a dispenser, dried and subsequently washed off. KOH pastes have been developed by two project partners. The concept allows achieving (at least for one of these pastes) good fill factor values and thus successfully interrupts the diffused area between front and rear side contacts. The biggest advantage of this method is that it is a technology that doe not apply mechanical stress to the wafer. Thus the selective KOH Si etching is suited for thin and fragile large area wafers. Novel metallisation pastes have been developed. New Ag paste formulations allow contacting shallow emitter regions (60 ohm/sq.). The solar cells manufactured with these pastes and shallow emitters showed the potential to result in excellent Jsc and FF values above 76 %. Thus the benefit of selective emitters compared to those shallow emitters is reduced and it is no more a must to go for a selective emitter development. At the same time alternative Al pastes have been developed that reduce the wafer bowing that is resulting from different thermal expansion coefficients of Al and Si after firing. This is very much needed when solar cells are processed from thin (200 µm) large area wafers. It could be shown that the wafer bowing on thin wafers can be reduced to less than 1 mm without loosing in efficiency. Several alternative concepts for the rear side metallisation applying only local rear side contacts have been evaluated and investigated. These concepts for rear side metallisation include boron diffusions from B pastes, SiNx:H passivation and an Al paste firing through the nitride layer. The integration of a local rear contact structure into an industrially advantageous processing sequence will still require more investigations and efforts. A characterisation method that is suited to determine the bulk lifetime and surface recombination velocity of wafers at all stages of the processing sequence has been developed, built up and successfully tested. First processes integrating the advantageous processes and pastes that were developed so far have been executed successfully in an industrial pilot line environment. Results and Dissemination plans: Good progress has been achieved in all work packages of the project. All deliverables and milestones that were foreseen until the MTA meeting were fulfilled. - Isotexturing processes have been developed and successfully demonstrated for both, multicrystalline wafers and EFG sheets. A wet bench that is suited for pre-diffusion cleaning and iso-texturing has been developed, designed and is currently under construction. - P pastes resulting in two different target emitter sheet resistance values and P surface concentrations (A: 1019 P atoms/cm3; B: >1020 P atoms/cm3) when applied in the same optimised diffusion step have been developed and investigated. Samples of a boron paste has been supplied as well. - Diffusion processes for homogeneous shallow emitter diffusion (60 ohm/sq.) have been developed, applied and optimised. - An advanced method for the parasitic edge removal applying no stress to the thin wafers has been developed based on a novel KOH paste suited for selective Si and PSG etching. Resulting fill factors of 76% and higher for POCl3 diffused solar cells demonstrate clearly that the parasitic junction removal is successfully performed with this contactless method. - Ag pastes allowing to contact shallow emitters (60 ohm/sq.) have been developed, supplied to the project partners and successfully applied after optimising the contact firing step. - Al pastes resulting in lower wafer bowing (= 1 mm bow on =125 x 125 mm2 wafers; full Al BSF) without degrading the Al back surface field (BSF) have been developed and successfully tested. - A transverse probe double wavelength lifetime measurement set-up has been designed, built up and successfully tested. This set-up is in principle suited to extract and monitor the minority carrier lifetime in the wafer bulk and the surface recombination velocities of the rear and front surfaces and thus will help further process optimisation - Necessary improvement for handling and metallisation printing of thin wafers has been identified and specified. - Alternative rear side metallisation schemes applying local rear contacts, rear surfaces passivation and reflector layers and suited isolation processes are under development - First attempts to run advanced integrated process sequences that are suited for thin mc-Si and EFG wafers have been successfully executed. - Solar cell efficiencies in excess of 16.1 % have been achieved on thin mc-Si wafers (MTA milestone: > 15.5 %)- Solar cell efficiencies of 14.5% on 200 µm thin and > 15 % on 300 µm thick 100 cm2, 3 ohm cm EFG wafers have been demonstrated (MTA milestone on thin EFG: 14.5 %).The advantageous results will be individually exploited by the respective project partners as described in the TIP (technology implementation plan). Merck and DuPont will try to commercialise the respective developed pastes. Astec will try to commercialise the developed wet bench concept. RWE SCHOTT Solar will try to implement the developed integral processing sequences including iso-texturing and shallow emitters. IMEC will disseminate the developed technologies through journal articles and conference proceedings and offer to transfer the gained know-how to interested PV companies. DIE-UNAP will offer the developed characterisation possibilities as commercially available service for a wider public and publish the scientifically relevant progress. Technion will publish the fundamental scientific know-how that has been gained and apply the etching and texturing technology also to other fields in the micro-electronic sector.

Of most concern are the proliferation of drug-resistant bacteria and the transfer of these bacteria from farm animals to humans. This year Denmark has made the landmark decision of banning antimicrobials as growth promoters in pigs. This decision reinforces several key actions in the 5th framework in 'finding antibiotic alternatives' and 'reducing their use in animal husbandry'. One option is the use of robotics or CE agents. We have recently discovered that bacterial spores are effective CE agents and can suppress the colonisation of an E. coil pathogen in poultry. Spores are remarkably robust and could be mixed with animal feed. We have assembled a group of three spore researchers and two commercial partners, coordinated by a leading Agricultural Research facility. We will determine how spores work as CE agents/robotics and commercially exploit them.

The multilingual portal provides Women and Professionals an easy access to Women health information, focused on menopause; the web EPR allows a European data collection and exchange. The aim of WOMAN II project is to enlarge the number of the existing 4 validation sites, in order to create a working European network for data collection and elaboration and to promote the usage of the web portal among citizens and professionals. The Consortium aims to obtain early competitive advantage with the respect to US competitors and the possibility to pass the barriers to successful exploitation (10 sites more). The work to be faced is the adaptation, tuning, customisation and improvement of the already available WOMAN results towards the European users' needs.  Objectives: The objectives of WOMAN II are: - to assess the WOMAN services and applications against an enlarged number of actors in new validation sites distributed over the European Union and 3rd countries; - to promote the usage of web technologies both to women and health professionals to offer continuing education, to keep up-to-date the Web site (www.womanlab.com); - to produce multilingual contents for the existing artefacts (information, services and applications are currently available only in English, Italian, Dutch and Spanish); - to integrate a network of competences, including expert epidemiologists, GPs and Gynaecologists to straighten the partnership and ensure an appropriate collection of significant data; - to start-up an International Steering Board in collaboration with European Menopause and Andropause Society (EMAS); - to carry on the dissemination of the achievements of the project, to create statistically significant databases for research, scientific and economical evaluation studies.  Work description: The results achieved in WOMAN are currently ""time to market"". A small number of further developments are needed for applying with success the solutions developed in the context of WOMAN to a European market. In this sense, the most important activity to be carried out is to validate the WOMAN products and services against a complete European user group. The approval of this take-up action, will certainly impact positively the WOMAN exploitation, contributing to fund the costs associated to the validation, adaptation, fine-tuning, customisation of the products.  The steps foreseen are: - Set Up Trial Scenarios (WOMAN EPR and services installation at all sites, WOMAN Local Web Sites Customisations); - Measurements and Validation (Fine tuning of WOMAN existing Validation Plan, WOMAN Validation); - Assessments (EPR fine tuning; - Local sites fine tuning; - Global site fine tuning: Contents, Language, Services); - Multilingual Translation (EPR Translation, Global Site Translation, Local Sites Translation); - Demonstration (Demonstration of EPR at local sites, Demonstration of EPR between cross sites, Demonstration of (WOMAN site services); - Dissemination (Involvement of new centres, Investigating market opportunity, Market validation exercises and trials, Business planning for the deployment phase).  The success of this take up action will create a network of experts working together using web technologies, will allow European women and professionals to find high quality and approved content in their own idiom, will allow the SMEs involved in the project to achieve an international acknowledgement and exploit the results in the EU market.  Milestones: Creation of a real European EPR network regarding menopause and a useful multilingual portal on Women health, where women and professionals could find information and services in their own idiom. The combination of the EPR and the portal, offers a real e-business model that could be used also in other domains. Within the 2002 the EPR will be translated in all EC languages (both at the user's interface and DB level), in order to really allow a European data collection regarding women health."

A distributed system, whose ultimate mission would be the transformation of statistical data to statistical information, should have accommodated fundamental requirements, inherent to the collection and integration of data from distributed sources. Among these, data validation is of utmost importance, and it has to take place as early in the information life cycle as possible. The project aims at the design and development of a generic, distributed and flexible data validation system, integrated in various phases of the statistical data process, in order to ensure and monitor data quality. The main concept underlying our approach is the treatment of validation rules as metadata as opposed to the usual approach of implementing case specific validation programs.  Objectives: The main objective of the project is the design and development of a generic, distributed and flexible data validation system, which will be able to be seamlessly integrated in the current (or future) processes of statistical data collection, in order to ensure and monitor data quality. The system will be accessible in a distributed way in order to validate large statistical data sets before their transmission or even throughout their production, ensuring homogeneity and consistency which are critical quality parameters of the validation process and the data quality in general. Among the critical project objectives are, the development of a formal framework for the classification and semantic notation of validation rules, the design, development and population of the rules repository, the development of the validation engine and a, Java application implemented, Validation Client.  Work description: The project consists of three phases each containing several work packages and tasks:  - Phase I includes the methodological work required for the elaboration of the background on which the development of the Validation System will be based. The analysis of information quality requirements and the derivation of an object model of the system belongs to WP1, the classification, algebraic definition and specification of the required validation rules, and the refinement of the object model towards a detailed metadata repository design, in WP2.  - The implementation of the derived module is achieved within Phase II, following the main building blocks of the system architecture. A specific workpackage is dedicated to each of these system modules. The Validation Rules Repository is in WP3, the Validation Engine in WP4 and the Validation Client in WP5.  - In the final stage, Phase III, the main system modules are integrated, used and tested for trial operation and validated, providing feedback and further input for the final technological implementation and Commercial Exploitation. Pilot Operation and Evaluation is in WP6, Technological Implementation Plan in WP7, Dissemination Activities in WP7, while WP0 provides the administrative and project monitoring infrastructure required.  Milestones: All major phases of the project produce concrete results and milestones: - In Phase I the detailed validation rules classification scheme and the metadata model are developed; - In Phase II the repository of validation rules and metadata, the validation engine and client; - In Phase III leads to the pilot testing and evaluation of the results, along with the exploitation and dissemination activities.

100|grant.3767918|HPCF-CT-2001-00274; 76124|Iasoc - x|Iasoc - x|The main goal of the proposed Euroconference IASOC - X is to bring together the best, most innovative investigators in the various fields of synthetic organic chemistry in order to debate the latest developments of the following topics: (i) homogeneous catalysis, with emphasis on enantioselective catalysis, (ii) combinatorial chemistry, applied to both drug and catalyst discovery/optimisation, (iii) synthesis of complex bioactive compounds, both from the academic viewpoint and from the industrial perspective. The field of organic synthesis is currently experiencing exciting changes as new methods emerge to make more complex compounds, more quickly and efficiently. The choice of these tightly connected topics has been carefully made in order to cover many areas of chemistry and relevant highlights from neighbouring disciplines. Pharmaceutical Companies are increasingly demanding the preparation of enantiomerically pure products on large scale.

Currently, it is impossible to predict who of these patients later will convert into patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). MCI patients will be compared with subjects from the normal aging population and in some cases with patients with probable AD. By the use of emission tomography techniques, our aim is an as extensive as possible in vivo mapping of neuroreceptor systems in normal aging and in the early phases of dementia, as well as to explore relevant investigational methods for differentiating between patients within these categories. We intend to relate the findings from functional imaging with the clinical measures in terms of emotional disturbances and neuropsychological findings as well within these categories. We intend to relate the findings from functional imaging with the basis of these results, we will settle the diagnostic value of neuroreceptor imaging tools, for an early diagnosis in the elderly patient with memory and/or emotional symptoms and hopefully be able to point at new potential areas for drug development.

The most ambitious tissue engineering schemes involve the processing in vitro of cell seeded constructs to induce the formation of neo-tissue through the utilisation of bioreactor technologies. The aim of this project is to develop a prototype intelligent integrated mini bioreactor (IMBIOTOR) to improve the efficacy and efficiency of manufacture of tissue engineered implants. The IMBIOTOR will support fully or semi-automated operation and maintenance of a closed aseptic environment during tissue processing. It will incorporate intelligent control and novel monitoring systems for biological output and the relevant feedback mechanisms necessary to provide optimum stimulation of neo-tissue formation. These objectives will be achieved through a multidisciplinary, multinational approach, with the aim of introducing the novel process into the emerging industry of tissue engineering.

This requires a radical challenge to current practices. A previous phase (ADFCS) identified the primary cost drivers, and addressed the equipment architecture to reduce the need for replication by improved fault detection and identification. ADFCS-II addresses 4 key cost drivers: the design process by the increased use of high-fidelity simulations and analysis tools; Fault Tolerant Control technologies to improve FCS effectiveness; actuation architectures to provide the required integrity and ensure the continuity of control; and the specification of a set of Flying Qualities Requirements to focus the design process.

The expected major achievements are: benefits for maintenance and inspection programmes, technical background to comply with current/future airworthiness regulations, establishment of a risk procedure for structures designed on damage- tolerant principles, identification of design keys which have economic potential and evaluation of partial safety factors to optimise the overall safety structure. The design benefits are realised through reduced aircraft weight or increased operating life whilst maintaining structural integrity (safety). The project is in support of EU policies on energy, environment, transport, economic, social cohesion, industry and research and technology

100|grant.3752078|IST-2000-26341; 58376; VITAMIN S|Visual Data Mining System|Visual Data Mining System|The aim of VITAMIN S project is to go beyond products and experience gained through involvement in other projects by designing an interactive environment for graphical data analysis, that offers innovative visualization and enhanced graphical data analysis methods, useful for users, statistician or not. Indeed, visual inspection can be considered the basic step of exploratory data analysis process. Using directly the obtained results as input for more complex numerical analysis, they allow a considerable reduction of such method computational cost. The system will provide linking between visualization methods where possible, so that the full potential of several visualization methods is used at the same time by the user during the analysis process.  Objectives: The objectives of VITAMIN S are: 1. Enhancement of classical graphical data analysis methods by incorporating dynamic and interactive techniques; 2. Implementation of innovative visualisation methods; 3. Some possible fields for methodological developments can be related to: NSI's typical data such as: Structured Data both at disaggregated and aggregated level, Time Series, and Spatial Data; 4. Integration of the implemented graphical and visualisation methods into a unique and homogeneous environment for a genuine Visual daTA MINing System (VITAMIN-S) by: - offering classical and innovative visualisation tools; - providing an interactive framework to explore multivariate data; - linking displays, so that the full potential of several visualisation methods can be used at the same time during the analysis process; - providing interactive reports that trace the data exploration steps.  Work description: The fulfilment of the project objectives requires under the two phases the following actions:  Phase A: - Identification of the needs of NSIs and end-users in relation to data exploration using visualisation methods; - Analysis of existing literature related to graphical methodologies in statistics, and finally assessment of s/w tools in an attempt to identify possible weakness on visualisation techniques; - Propose and define the functional specifications of enhanced classical graphical methods as well as propose innovative visualisation methods.  This will be done based on concrete criteria such as: - user group requirements like: 1) need to help in the data exploration of specific data sets; 2) usefulness; 3) applicability and generality; 4) degree of existing software coverage; 5) willingness of potential customers to pay  - resources available; - suitability for future commercialisation; - Design a prototype demonstrating a visualisation method by using specific data sets (the ISTAT Multiscope Survey, and the time series database of the ONS).  Phase B: - Evolution of the prototype into the proposed full-blown VITAMIN-S system; - Validation and verification of project objectives; - Exploitation of results.  In both phases careful management of project resources and efficient co-operation among them will be maintained.  Milestones: 1. Accurate capture of user requirements; 2. Propose innovative visualisation methods; 3. Development of a prototype; 4. Develop of the fully-blown VITAMIN-S system; 5. Consolidation of the achieved results and gain of the acceptance of the users; 6. Enlargement of the potential user's basis; 7. Assuring of the commercial viability of the system.

Screening for and expressing thermostable enzymes of industrial interest from sulfolobus and other crenarchaeotes|The European sulfolobus project. Screening for and expressing thermostable enzymes of industrial interest from sulfolobus and other crenarchaeotes|The Crenarchaeotes constitute a kingdom of the Archaea that contains a very diverse range of microorganisms many of which are extreme- or hyperthermophiles. They differ extensively genetically and biochemically from Bacteria and Eukaryotes. Sulfolobus is the best studied of these organisms and most of ground-breaking work on this organism has been done in Europe. The purpose of this project is to exploit this European advantage and to screen for novel enzyme activities both at the genomic level and in an extensive and unique European collection of thermophilic Crenarchaeotes. Moreover, we will develop and refine vector systems for expressing these proteins in a range of Bacterial and Eukaryotic hosts by modifying the Archaeal genetic signals. In particular, we will develop, for the first time, a vector-host system for expressing Crenarchaeal enzymes in Sulfolobus on a large scale.

A major bottleneck for industrial applications of hyper solutes is the large-scale production at a competitive cost. The major goal of this project is the development of cell systems eternised for the production of mannosylglycerate; the most widely distributed hyper solute. Two strategies will be pursued: i) engineering of expression and secretion systems in suitable hosts; ii) optimisation of fermentation of natural producers. Trials will be conducted that will widen the range of application of mannosylglycerate. The involvement of industrial partners ensures that the results will reach end-users.

AWARENET is the first network for agro-food waste prevention, minimisation and recovery. The innovation of AWARENET proposal is that it will integrate the vision of the agro-food industrial waste problem from three different and critical points of view: regulatory issues, technology and market, with the final objective of proposing a global R&D European strategy for agro-food industrial waste. The European environmental regulations and the current best practices for minimisation and ""valorisation"" of wastes will be compiled and checked all over Europe. The network activities will help the European agro-food industries to describe simple tools for wastes prevention, minimisation and recovery. A ""white book"" will be prepared as a manual for dissemination. AWARENET will identify the market opportunities for ""valorised"" products from agro-food waste and define the R&D needs for agro-food waste."

Symbolic analysis is an extension of statistical data analysis methods to more complex objects called Symbolic Objects. ASSO will improve the software developed in SODAS project in order to render it more operational and attractive following the users requests as well as to add new innovative methods and to meet the needs of statistical offices.  Objectives: The general objective of ASSO is to design methods, methodology and software tools for the analysis of multidimensional complex data (numerical or non numerical) coming from very large databases in statistical offices and administrations. Symbolic analysis extends statistical data analysis methods to more complex objects. Individuals processed by these methods are complex in the sense they represent groups of individuals, featuring variation among each group of individuals. Within the context of the project, the complex objects are called symbolic objects. The aim of the ASSO project is to improve the software built previously in order to render it more operational and attractive following users requests, to add new innovative methods and to meet needs of statistical offices.  Work description: ASSO project will allow adaptation of statistical concepts to the dynamical global environment, will suggest methodology of treatments and will give guidance on understanding the data.

The project aims to (i) develop high-resolution geophysical and physiological (e.g. sap-flow) techniques for the study of water in soils, roots and trees; (ii) evaluate methods for studying evapotranspiration at a single tree scale and for scaling up to communities and catchments, including the use of satellite remote-sensing; (iii) use large-scale multi-user field experiments to compare the techniques (iv) develop models for integrating these results for hydrological purposes. The 1st phase involves laboratory and field characterisation of novel techniques as well as the theoretical and experimental development of hardware and software. The 2nd phase is the intercomparison of the various techniques, in case studies in Portugal and Italy (emphasis on the scaling up of tree-scale to plots and catchments). The final phase will be the development of integrative models providing, in a user-friendly manner, critical hydrological information for managers and policy-makers.

Information Management in this context is taken to have a wider meaning than just the content that is of interest to users. It encompasses: Rich, diverse and interactive content drawn from both web resources intended to be delivered over the Internet and interactive digital broadcast content; Metadata describing these diverse resources; User profiles describing user preferences, both on content and access configuration; Advanced search and notification services (traditionally called Selective Dissemination of Information SDI); Information Object Agent technology capable of comparing resources and their metadata descriptions to identify related materials; Distributed software technology for dynamic management and update of metadata, with specific reference to problems related to availability and accessibility of multimedia resources.  Objectives: Validate the extended CMI Data Model for reliable and consistent user tracking across Terrestrial Networks and Digital Broadcast; Construct advanced search capabilities within the Mediation Service utilising IEEE Learning Objects Metadata (LOM) to describe information objects and IEEE PAPI to describe individuals and their preferences; Evaluate proposed mechanisms for dynamic personalisation of services according to the delivery platform selected. Note that this will require the reconciliation of PAPI 'application' preferences with the CC/PP device capabilities and 'browser' preferences; Experiment with how the GESTALT QoS metadata can be used (and possibly extended) to support operation across these technologies and negotiate appropriate levels of QoS; Prove the proposed integration strategy for the back-end management and tracking of information services, thus demonstrating the feasibility of common services accessible from the office, the factory and the home; To propose a scheme for distributed, on-line synchronisation of metadata to allow the inclusion of dynamic information such as quality of service parameters, cost, and availability of resources.  Work description: The GUARDIANS project will build upon the results generated by the GESTALT project in the 4th Framework ACTS Programme. GESTALT defined a flexible, component-based architecture for the discovery and delivery of modular training and education services. GUARDIANS will focus on the following areas to extend this architecture utilising the emerging technologies identified in the text below. The focus will be expanded from a purely learning/training domain to encompass more generic Information Management issues. These include Mediation Services, Distributed User Profile Services, Reusable Object Technology, Customised Cross-Platform Delivery and Distributed Management of Metadata. GUARDIANS will adopt the IEEE Computer Mediated Instruction (CMI) draft specification (currently draft 3.0.1) as the model for service provider interaction with delivered information objects. A content API which utilises Java wrapper technology has been defined for the CMI data model and the US-based Advanced Distributed Learning Programme have produced a draft XML DTD for the CMI. A key task for the project will be adapting the evolving CMI Data Model for the description of discrete, fine-grained information objects, which will emerge from the convergence of training with information services. Despite the diversity of the selected access technologies, there is still a need for a unified model for capturing user responses in terms of managing these services and tracking user understanding of the information objects presented. Based on the reusable object technology developed in the project around the CMI Data Model and the related Content API, the project will produce demonstrable information object content and appropriate user environments for each of the delivery modes.  Milestones: M1: Project management established, requirements and evaluation criteria agreed; M2: Data model and API design completed; M3: Component designs completed; M4: Data model and API feedback for evaluation; M5: Components implemented; M6: Integrated GUARDIANS system; M7: Completion of evaluation.

Has established a network of paediatric centres and collaborating laboratories from 11 European countries to undertakemulticentre clinical trials. With the prolongation of disease-free life associated with potent antiretroviral therapy(ART), new therapies are evaluated in adult trials using endpoints of viral load reduction and immune response. However, there are important differences between adults and children in these parameters. Pharmacokinetic studies are essential as some drugs such as the protease inhibitors are metabolised faster in children and extrapolating from adult data would result in under dosing which could increase the risk of developing resistance to HIV. Increased collaboration with other international groups running studies in HIV infected children is planned for new trials and for undertaking meta-analyses. Collaboration and communication between clinical centres will be increased through pentad newsletter, training exchanges and the development of a PENTA website.

This will lead to a reduction in pesticide use, safe food and more sustainable production. Fusarium species will be diagnosed and quantified using newly developed PCR techniques and mycotoxins quantified. Risk assessment models will be developed using data obtained from controlled environment experiments and improved further using field data collected from 80sites from four European countries.
100|grant.2751135|MC_U120061476|Genome Function|Genome Function|The last 20 years have witnessed a formidable increase in the information about the genome, including the genomic sequence, the genes that are active in normal and pathological situations, and the molecular machinery involved. But advances in areas such as gene therapy and cell therapy require a deeper knowledge of genome function, as the conditions inside the cell nucleus are very different from those used in the laboratory. The human genome is found in 23 DNA molecules, or chromosomes, each with an average of 1500 different genes. For example, when a new gene is artificially introduced into the genome, we know little about how it may interfere with the expression of neighbouring genes and with the stability of the receiving genome. The different chromosomes fold in specific arrangements that are permissive for the activity of some genes, or maintain other genes silent. We study these processes using a variety of methods, including high-resolution imaging, molecular biology and biochemistry. We investigate how chromosomes and genes fold in the nucleus, and how they interact with the cellular machinery involved in the expression of genes. This work will allow us to better understand how the genome works and help devise more efficient and safer gene and cell therapies.  Technical Summary We investigate the mechanisms by which the structural and functional organisation of the genome and transcription machinery in the mammalian cell nucleus contributes to the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. This research will help to understand the processes of cell pluripotency, plasticity and differentiation. We work mainly with human and murine cell lines and tissues. We use a combination of biochemical, molecular biology and subcellular imaging methods to investigate long-range inter-chromosomal interactions, the dynamics and proteomic content of transcription factories, and epigenetic roles of poised RNA polymerase II forms. We are currently developing a novel high-throughput assay to describe and quantify whole-genome interactions in cell nuclei. This will provide quantitative information on genome folding inside the mammalian nucleus that will permit modelling of chromosome organisation and may in the future allow for prediction of more efficient and safer integration sites for gene therapy, diagnostic of stem cell properties in regenerative therapy and a better understanding of the chromosomal rearrangements that lead to cancer. As the technology has commercial potential, we are working towards filing a patent.-Objectives:-1. To investigate the functional and structural organisation of chromatin in interphase nuclei and how it influences gene expression and epigenetic processes;-2. To study the roles of poised RNA polymerase II complexes at silent genes in embryonic stem cells and the mechanistic interplay with Polycomb-dependent gene silencing;-3. To biochemically purify and characterise pol II factories towards devising genetic analyses to investigate how the organisation of RNA polymerase in transcription factories influences genome organisation and gene expression.

These improvements can only be achieved through large-scale validation on new design, manufacturing and test technologies by the key European airframe manufacturers and their supply chain. The TANGO Project aims to achieve these improvements of key pre-production airframe structures and thereby facilitate full-scale industrial implementation. Within the project, four such test structures will be constructed, specifically, a composite wing box and metal to composite joint, a composite joint, a composite centre wing box, a composite fuselage section and an advanced metallic fuselage section. The early stages of the project will consist of structural performance definition and design work together with a detailed evaluation of each of the proposed technologies. Once this phase is complete, a subset of technologies will be selected for use in the construction of each of the structures. The airframe manufacturers involved in the project and members of their supply chain will then build the necessary sub-assemblies and components. On completion of the manufacturing phase, each member of the Airbus Industry consortium will be responsible for the assembly and testing of one of the airframe elements listed above.

The construction of tried and tested interactive assessment modules is a costly process and thus collaborative effort, resource sharing and outsourcing this activity where appropriate should reduce costs to the educational institution, whilst also ensuring greater comparability between assessments being set across institutions.  OBJECTIVES To establish how learning objects exploiting the state-of-the-art in pedagogical adaptation can be integrated with the emerging Question and Test specification from the IEEE; To gauge the effectiveness and feasibility of utilising RDF/RDF Schema, BSR and the emerging Dublin Core v2.0 to support remote, cross-domain searching of online resources; To develop and test a course constructor kit, offering access to repositories both within and external to the institution by which educators can rapidly configure new course offerings from pre-authored materials, both using innovative pedagogy-rich resources (exploiting adaptive content and interactive assessment) as well as more traditional resources.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK : The EASEL project will explore technologies which can be brought together to offer course constructors an environment in which they can readily combine existing learning objects to create new online educational offerings. This will necessitate access to: (1) Learning Object Repositories, both owned by the institution (or consortia of institutions) and available from third-party suppliers, (2) Predefined Assessment Banks, again both owned by the institution(s) and available from third-party suppliers; (3) A web-based search gateway offering cross-domain access to services external to the institution (eg learning object repositories, assessment banks, digital libraries, museums, online information services, statistical and scientific databases) and (4) A construction kit offering access to cross-domain search facilities and allowing the user to construct learning programmes and discrete modules which can be reused across the curriculum and customised for individual learners. Central to the project is the commitment to exploit emerging standards and provide input to the standards formation process. The IEEE Question & Test working group is currently working on a draft of a taxonomy of interactive assessment styles and an XML schema by which assessment results can be exchanged between the learning object and a management system to achieve tracking of learner progress. EASEL will make a significant contribution to this global effort.

In genetically susceptible individuals, gluten ingestion results in intestinal mucosa damage and malabsorption of essential nutrients. The coeliac-EU cluster groups together three research programmes with complementary scientific objectives:  To establish the prevalence of oeliac disease in a large European population. To characterise the genetic basis of this common food intolerance. To identify factors involved in the gluten-triggered pathogenesis of mucosal damage.   EXPECTED RESULTS  The epidemiology study will : Provide an estimate of the prevalence of oeliac disease in Europe. Allow identification and early treatment of 'silent' oeliac people who are so far not detected.  The genetic study will : Identify association(s) between gene(s) and the oeliac disease. Clarify the contribution of the HLA genetic components and their association with other (non-HLA) genetic markers.  The pathogenesis study will : Characterise features of damage in the oeliac mucosa. Provide information on factors involved in the pathogenesis of mucosal damage, in particular on T cells involvement.   APPLICATIONS  A new simple serological diagnostic test, suitable for large population screening and allowing an easier and earlier detection of the disease, will be validated. A non-invasive genetic test based on DNA analysis may potentially be developed in the future.  New therapeutic strategies, for instance based on immuno-modulation, may potentially be developed in the future.

The present project provides solutions to the need for reliable measuring and testing methodologies and instrumentation for quality assessment of DEXA technology, with emphasis on real-time, in-site measurement of particle size and composition. This will be achieved deploying beyond state-of-the art methodologies (measurement of joint particle size-composition distributions with optical, irradiation, electrical mobility and aerodynamic techniques) through a measurement and testing campaign based on: procurement and benchmarking of techniques followed by studies for the assessment of engine management strategies and their synergistic interplay with after treatment technology. This will facilitate the advent of measurement and testing methodologies that have the potential to become the future basis for new and emerging technologies for monitoring and controlling particulate emissions."

The full costs of AD to EU nations are very high. Due to demographic changes within Europe, the prevalence of AD and costs to the EU are likely to increase dramatically over the next four decades. There are currently no effective therapies for AD. Deposition of amyloidal beta peptide (Abita) within the brains of AD patients is believed to be central to the pathogenesis of the disease. Abita is derived by proteolysis cleavage from the precursor protein. APP. Recently, two families pf proteins, the Fe65s and Axis, have been shown to bind to APP and significantly influence APP processing and Abita production. The purpose of this project is to understand further the mechanisms by witch Fee and X11a influence APP processing and Abita production in AD. Another objective of the project is to explore the relevance of a recently discovered phenomenon (molecular misreading) witch causes the accumulation in AD brains of aberrant proteins. This work will lead to the generation of new AD animal models and to relevant knowledge to design innovative therapeutic strategies and new diagnostic tools.

Some of the observed phenomena cannot be explained if polarization processes in the rocks are neglected, e.g. negative values in the decay response curves of transient coincident loop methods and high resolution of electromagnetic soundings.  For the complete investigation of the problem it is necessary to have reliable data on electromagnetic properties of rocks over a wide frequency range. However, data about the frequency dispersion of different electrical parameters are still rare. Therefore it is one of the central tasks of the project to extend significantly our knowledge of the frequency dispersion of different rocks both by means of laboratory studies of rock samples and by a theoretical analysis of the problem. On the basis of the data obtained, the influence of polarization processes on electromagnetic prospecting methods, particularly on transient electromagnetic field soundings, will be investigated. It is expected that the results of these studies will allow us to substantiate a new field procedure for transient electromagnetic fields and a new method of data interpretation, which will permit a separation of conduction and polarization effects and thus will yield a substantial increase of the information content of transient electromagnetic data.

We approach the study of human diseases by understanding their structure/function relationship. The role of the molecular structure in modern biology and medicine may be directly appreciated if we consider that structure determination of the DNA, the molecule which contains the whole genetic information, unveiled the secret of life. Our laboratory focuses on determining the 3D structure of proteins with specific interest for proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases such as the Huntington Chorea, Friedreich ataxia, and Fragile X syndrome and muscular pathologies such as different types of cardio-myopathies. Despite the different symptoms, these diseases, all incurable, share the fact that in affected patients, the proteins encoded by the corresponding genes are produced in altered forms, or in smaller quantity down to their complete absence. By determining the shape of the proteins involved we can then understand the role of these mutations on the protein functions and ultimately design new therapeutical strategies. We use a combination of biochemical and biophysical techniques which help us to reconstruct the cellular role of the proteins of interest and characterise their structure/function relationship  Technical Summary We focus on neurodegeneration and muscular pathologies.--A molecular approach to human genetic diseases More than 12 human genetic diseases have been associated with expansions of nucleotide repeats in their corresponding genes, all identified in the last 10 years. These diseases, currently incurable, are interesting both for their impact in the human population and for the unusual pattern of genetic behaviour. They are grouped into two sub-families according to whether the expansion occurs in coding or non-coding regions. In our group we have started an integrated approach which makes use of different biochemical and biophysical techniques to study the structure and function of the proteins encoded by several genes of the trinucleotide expansion family. Amongst them are FMRP, the protein responsible for fragile x and frataxin, the protein involved for Friedreichs ataxia. We want to understand the cellular role of these proteins and describe the mechanism of molecular recognition with their binding partners. We have also recently setup a systems biology project which aims at understanding the process of iron-sulfur cluster formation, in which frataxin is involved.--How muscles are assembled and regulated Understanding the molecular bases of muscle contraction has been one of the main research topics in biology for the last decades. Besides actin and myosin, which are the main players in muscle contraction, many other proteins have an essential role in determining muscle assembly and regulation. Several interactions have been described recently which are essential to anchor the muscle filaments to the modular proteins, such as titin, nebulin, and alpha-actinin. Dysfunctions in the interactions cause different types of cardio-myopathies and other muscle diseases. We are currently working to determine the structure of a number of protein complexes. This information will eventually allow us to reconstruct the muscle ultrastructure.

To promote natural biological, physical and low-chemical control strategies for fungal pathogens. Alternatives to methyl bromide and the reduction of fungicide use in European strawberry cropping systems by developing natural biological, physical and low-chemical control strategies for fungal pathogens.  2. To select naturally occurring strains of Trichoderma active against the principal fungal pathogens c'ollelotrichum, Phytophthora and Botrytis, and to explore their use singly and in combination in laboratory and field conditions.  3. To assess the efficacy and survival of selected Trichoderma strains in conjunction with solarization techniques, and to investigate the effects of their application on beneficial soil organisms.  4. To develop novel biocides from Trlchoderma proteins to protect strawberry fruit from pre- and post-harvest dlseases.  5. To explore the synergistic effects of the various control measures developed, and to recommend integrated strategies for strawberry production with minimal chemical input.   PROPOSAL CONTENT Strawberry production is one of the EU agroindustries most dependent on methyl bromide fumigation for pest and pathogen control. Production is concentrated in the less developed southern European regions, so phasing out of mebr will have a disproportionate effect on these emerging economies, and will increase dependence on chemical control measures. Strawberry crops in California are predicted to decline by 25% without mebr treatments, and similar reductions may be expected in Mediterranean countries where strawberries are farmed intensively on US-style models. Our research will allow replacement of unsustainable cultivation practices with environmentally friendly Integrated Pest/Pathogen Management (IPM)-based systems, centred on biocontrol of pathogens using Trichoderma agents. These are already widely used in high-value crop production, but are currently not sufficiently developed for use on strawberry pathogens. Trichoderma strains have beneficial effects in agricultural systems other than pathogen control, principally through increasing soil fertility by the active breakdown of organic matter. This process is currently seriously hindered by the non-specific action of mebr and similar chemical fumigants, which destroy natural microbiologically mediated disease suppression in soil, and encourage rapid recolonization by pathogens. There are three major novel strands to our proposal, involving synergies between different control measures. Firstly, combinations of selected (but not genetically modified) Trichoderma strains will be explored as soil and foliar additives, in order to increase the effectiveness and range of pathogen control. Secondly, biocontrol strains will be integrated with solarization techniques for partial soil sterilization. We believe that Trichoderma strains will be compatible with solarization preferentially, allowing the maintenance of permanent pathogenantagonistic soil systems. Thirdly, we shall combine traditional Trichoderma biocontrol systems with novel antifungal agents derived from Trichoderma enzymes, which may be used as environmentally friendly foliar sprays or post-harvest treatments. We shall also investigate synergies of biocontrol organisms and products with minimal doses of chemical control agents, to develop protocols which maximise control but minimize inputs. We will identify and promote optimal control systems using components from our IPM spectrum, which should result in effective control of strawberry diseases on a long-term sustainable basis. The experimental processes will act as a model for developing environmentally friendly control measures for pests and pathogens of other mebr-dependent crops.

This is because these members of the EU have recently experienced massive increases in legal and non-legal migration and an associated increase in social integration. The Proposal is designed to support the development of an enhanced research and training capability in the universities of four Mediterranean countries in disciplines relevant for this field.  More specifically, the proposal has the following objectives: - To review the social science research and training capacity in the filed of migration and ethnic studies in four Mediterranean countries - To assess the quality and quantity of research students specialising in this field - To consider strategies for strengthening the research and training infrastructure, and to make appropriate recommendations.  The project is not a conditional research exercise but falls centrally the area of 40 grants where the applicant would serve as a visiting professor in an institution located in a less favoured region for the purposes of imparting relevant experience and knowledge. The experience concerned is primarily derived from five years as founding director of the largest European research institute in this field.

This will be accomplished by a coordinated investigation of a number of key parameters of model proteins from pH-extremophilic microbes with a representative selection of experimental and theoretical methods governed by three expert teams from NIS and two from INTAS countries. The research will focus on transaminases from Bacillus species having high and low pH-optima of growth.  The enzymes isolated from Bacillus and recombinant E. coli cells will be used for extensive enzymological and physico-chemical characterisation. To analyse folding and stability, transaminases and their mutants will be investigated under increasingly denaturing solvent conditions (variable pH, temperature and denaturant concentration) by a combination of spectroscopic and thermodynamic approaches. An extensive research on kinetics will be performed to characterise the stability of tertiary and quaternary structure of transaminases through kinetic parameters. Spatial structures of the proteins will be elucidated by crystallographic studies. The experimental results will be supplemented with computer model building to illustrate the differences between alkaliphilic, neutrophilic and acidophilic enzymes. The secondary, tertiary, and quaternary interactions that contribute to folding and stability of unique spatial structure of the transaminases from pH-extremophiles will be compared with stabilisation factors revealed for other extremophiles. The results will expand the knowledge of the very bases of protein chemistry, and may be exploited in constructing of enzymes stable and active at high or low pH for the needs of medicine, industry, agriculture and other areas

100|grant.3743285|BIO4980314; 46732|Novel compounds that inhibit the activation of CD4-positive T cells as immunosuppressive agents|Novel compounds that inhibit the activation of CD4-positive T cells as immunosuppressive agents|The present proposal foresees the synthesis of peptides and, in the following, of peptidomimetics corresponding to a discrete, non-polymorphic domain of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. On the basis of theoretical considerations and preliminary results such compounds are expected to interfere with the antigen-specific activation of CD4-positive T cells through a novel mechanism of action. Thus, such peptides should not act through occupation of the antigen-binding groove of M:HC class II molecules nor through inhibition of the binding of CD4 coreceptors to MHC class II molecules.   Preliminary results have shown that linear, up to 16 amino acid long peptides corresponding to said domain, are indeed able to inhibit antigen-specific T cell activation as determined by measuring proliferative responses in mixed leukocyte reactions (MLR) and of T cell clones in response to their specific antigen. Further studies showed that the active peptides affected CD4-positive, but not CD8positive T cells. Reduced proliferation was paralleled by reduced production of interleukin 2 (IL-2), the main growth factor responsible for proliferation of activated T cells. On the other hand, no significant modification of the up-regulated expression of highaffinity IL-2 receptors was observed. These results are consistent with the hypothesized mechanism of action. More direct evidence in favour of this was obtained, on living cells, with a novel imaging technique.   The work programme foresees the synthesis of other peptides that will be shorter than the parent compounds and of constrained chemical structure. Further peptides and peptidomimetics will be synthesized having properties that should make them suitable for in vivo administration and, eventually, as pharmacological agents for diseases states that are the consequence of activation and expansion of CD4positive T cells. It is planned to perform, with these compounds, in vitro tests in order to quantify their immunosuppressive potency and to evaluate the functional consequences of their activity on T cells and, eventually, in vivo tests in animal models in order to evaluate their therapeutic potential.   In addition, we plan to implement the use of the indicated imaging technique. This shall expand our knowledge on the biological event that has suggested to us the possibility to synthesize molecules able to interfere with it. Compounds synthesized during the present project will be tested in this assay. Further activities that are expected to deepen our understanding of the functional consequences of said event foresee the generation of transfected cell lines expressing mutated forms of MHC class II molecules. Submission of the present proposal as well as the activities that led to its preparation are in fulfillment of a preparatory grant (Stage 1 Contract No. B104-CT97-9067) that has been awarded to two of the partners participating to the present network.

The development of such ""second generation vaccines"" represents a priority target for the IVth Framework of the EC and requires the development of innovative technology and generic systems which can be used against a broad spectrum of diseases. The overall aim of this proposal is to exploit advances in recombinant DNA technology and the well defined genetics of the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus subtilis to develop spores as a generic system for the development of such ""second generation vaccines"".  B. subtilis spores offer a number of unique features making them particularly suitable as a generic vaccine vehicle: 1. Non-pathogenic 2. Dormant with suitable storage and desiccation properties 3. Suitable for non-parenteral delivery, particularly by the oral and nasal route 4. Ubiquitous with no evidence for compromised immune status in man 5. Ease of genetic modification 6. Produced in large quantities; safely, efficiently and cost effectively 7. Robust and suitable for field use, particularly in the developing world  In preliminary work we have begun to develop spores as a tool for heterologous antigen presentation and shown that spores are immunogenic since administration of non-recombinant spores by the oral or intranasal route elicits spore-specific serum IgG and secretory IgA (SIgA) in the rectum and vagina. In addition, we have been able to stably express an SIV antigen (gag p27) on the spore surface demonstrating the potential of spores for delivering antigens to target the immune response.  SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES  Our initial experiments have demonstrated the potential of using non-pathogenic B. subtilis spores for generic vaccine development. Here, 5 major European laboratories with considerable experience in either Bacillus genetics, mucosal immunity and in vaccine development will combine their expertise to fully demonstrate and validate the use of spores as a vaccine vehicle. Our goals are to optimise antigen presentation using spores and fully characterise the systemic and mucosal immune responses following oral or intranasal delivery of recombinant spores. We have chosen two model antigens (i) the capsid protein of Simian Immunodeficiency virus (SIV gag p27) and, (ii) tetanus toxoid fragment C ( ITFC). Both are candidate proteins for inclusion in a vaccine against two important pathogens for which we have the relevant animal models and expertise in place to address efficacy. Our work plan will follow 8 distinct work packages as outlined below.  WP 1 and 2: Construction and characterization of recombinant spores: WP 3: Parenteral immunization of mice with recombinant spores to determine the immunogenicity of the gag p27 or TTFC proteins.

It will be interconnected with and highly complementary to the Network of Excellence in superconductivity SCENET established by the ESPRIT-LTR programme on October 1st, 1996 for three-year duration. The latter, on the other hand, shall act in the field of electronic applications to set-up coherent strategies of research and development and create links between academia and industries. The main activities of ENPAS will include: the creation of S working groups each consisting of a small number of laboratories collaborating in pilot projects, the organisation of workshops for these pilot projects with relatively small numbers of participants, and the organisation of an advanced school on applications of superconductivity. ENPAS will also aim at establishing a common pool of scientific and technological knowledge for industries and academia through training of young advanced students and researchers.  To get from the present state of the art to the proposed objectives, several actions will be implemented: 1) Organisation of working groups to assess and define the specifications necessary for producing a demonstrator/prototype of: i) FCL's; ii) transmission cables; iii) magnets for MRI and energy storage; iv)motors. A fifth working group will assess the situation on superconducting materials from the novel ones to the production of wires and tapes. To discuss the current status of progress and the strategy plan for advancement in Europe, ENPAS will organise ten (2 per pilot project) meetings. Six-monthly reports will be produced. The prototypes production is visioned for the second stage of ENPAS with the support of industry and eventually of the European Commission; 2) Support of 24 extended exchange visits (up to 6 months) for transfer of young personnel among research groups participating in the pilot projects. The main aim of the visits is to facilitate bilateral transfers of expertise and experience; 3) Circulation of regular newsletters (3 times a year) in hard copy or on www; 4) Organisation of two schools on power applications of superconductivity and related enabling science. These schools (3-week long), which will be highly didactical, will be held in 1999 and 2000.The aim of the school will be to train young researchers from academia to work in industry. 5) Production of annual status reports on activities insuper conductivity, including Japan and USA, which should reveal how to narrow the gap in important areas where Europe is falling behind the US and Japan. The network will be directed by a 15-member Steering/Organising Committee, chaired by M. Marezio, of which 5 members are from industry. The network will initially include 33 nodes from government organisations and universities and 18 from industry. Membership will be open to any appropriate group by application. The total budget of ENPAS will be 1005890 ECU: pilot project meetings: 237000 (including 20% local overhead), Steering Committee meetings:23600, advanced school on the applications of superconductivity:254240,exchange visits of 6 months each: 210000, one monographic workshop: 55150,6issues of the Newsletter: 6000, labour-manager for three years: 90000,labour-technical assistant for three years: 60000, overhead (10%): 69900.
100|grant.3744515|SMT4982247; 47444|Silicon for mass unit and standard|Silicon for mass unit and standard|Background: One of the main objectives of the Metrology is redefining the mass unit in terms of atomic or fundamental constants in order to replace the definition in terms of the artefact kept at the BIPM. If the uncertainty associated to the Avogadro constant (NA) could be reduced at values less than 1x10-8 it would be possible to fix a conventional value for it. Since the atomic mass of 12C has been fixed equal to 12,00, the kilogram would be defined: the mass of (1000 g/12g) NA atoms of 12C.This 'atomic' definition holds also for other substances, since the value of their molar mass is sufficiently accurate (at 1x10-8 level). One of the promising methods for NA determination, leading also to the standard realisation, is the x-ray crystal method: it considers that in an ideal (Silicon) crystal the macroscopic density (p) is equal to that of the cubic unit cell, e.g. to the ratio between the mass of eighth Si atoms (molar mass M(Si)/ NA) and the volume of the cubic cell (a0)3with side a0. At present, through the absolute determination of these quantities, NA is determined with an accuracy of 0,5ppm, but a discrepancy of 3ppm, not yet explained since 1994, exists between two NA determinations carried out on two crystals, equally pure, perfect, grown in Europe and in Japan.  Objectives: This project, through: 1) the structural, chemico-physical characterisation of crystals grown with different techniques, but from the same materials; 2) differential determinations in different points of crystals of the quantities involved in NA measurements; 3) a comparative investigation of the sensitivity of methods detecting the density of vacancy and voids in crystals ,aims at finding a qualitative and quantitative justification of this discrepancy , which represents a limit, not only for a new mass unit definition, but also to the improvement of silicon quality for the Nanoelectronics devices of next generation.  Work programme: a) confirming the hypothesis that the discrepancies come from different characteristics of the materials; b) checking (to exclude) the influence of inaccurate determinations determining the most significant properties of crystalline silicon, of evaporated films and porous silicon. Collecting all data concerning the same Si material, in view of its application as reference material (lattice parameter, isotopic composition, density standard); c) constructing a lattice comparator operating in Bragg geometry for lattice spacing comparisons; d) determining the limits of homogeneity and repeatability of crystals grown with current techniques. State of progress: The project started on the 1/11/1998.
100|grant.3732577|BRPR980673; 45720; DILAMP|Diode lasers in material processing|Diode lasers in material processing|The improving characteristics of power, efficiency, wavelength, intensity and quality of CO2 and Nd:YAG sources have continuously widened the range of the cost/effective utilisation of the technology to manufacturing. The number of applications of laser to welding and surface treatments albeit growing remains rather restricted for the time being. To enable the widespread use of efficient automated laser material processing systems in manufacturing it is necessary for the cost and size of laser systems to go down and for the efficiency and reliability to go up. High power diode lasers (HPDL) offer the potential for this to happen in a major way. Compared to traditional sources HPDL are advantageous in terms of efficiency, maintenance and output power modularity. A further advantage which concern the previous processes lies in the higher absorption at metallic surfaces compared to CO2 and even Nd:YAG lasers. Their compact size and the rapidly decreasing costs (possibly aiming towards $10/watt) are likely to make HPDL achieve a major breakthrough in industrial applications. For this to happen one has to overcome their critical limit, which is the low beam quality. With the currently available HPDL sources it is difficult to obtain a small spot sizes and with such spot sizes only a few of the considered processes can be carried out, all are slowed down. The goal of the project therefore is to develop a new laser source of suitable output power (3 kW), brightness and efficiency such as to provide enough power intensity to support the above processes in a cost effective way. The new device will then be applied to these processes with the purpose of qualifying both the source and the processes. It is hoped by this approach to accelerate the diffusion of the technology. Preliminary process studies will also be performed using the commercially available HPDL source, which will have lower power (0.5-1.5 kW) and lower beam quality.

The most widely used reconstruction method is currently the substitution of the injured tendon/ligament with autologous tissue. Nevertheless, the drawbacks of this painful therapy are the initial low strength, the high probability of rupture during the early post repair phase, the long recovery period, the low availability of suitable material to harvest and creation of a new injury at the harvest site. Artificial prostheses should indeed provide a good solution for tendon or ligament reconstruction, as they can be manufactured in any required size, be ready to use and reduce operating time. All the prostheses, which are nowadays commercially available (generally consisting of alloplastic material) however, have shown low reliability mainly in terms of wear but also in terms of strength, elasticity, and biocompatibility (i.e. chronic syovitis).  Therefore, the high failure rate of the ""first generation"" synthetic ligaments and tendons and the drawbacks of the autologous transplant open the need for new and effective solutions. On these premises, the objective of the project is to develop a completely novel hybrid bioartificial ligament and tendon prostheses able to adequately emulate the complex structure-&-function of the natural tissues and consistently improve the success rate and avoid the side effects of the currently available treatment. The strategy hereby proposed for the development of these new reconstruction devices is that to imitate the composite structure of the natural tendon/ligament as closely as possible. Natural tendons and ligaments are highly complex structures, constituted by a protein phase (i.e. collagen and elastin), a polysaccharide phase (i.e. proteoglycans) and a cellular phase. A good reproduction of the mechanical and biological features of the natural tendon/ligament is hence impossible to obtain with a single alloplastic material.  The industrial aim of the project is therefore to develop device-engineering technologies by combining: - knitting, braiding and filament winding technologies; - technologies for modification of surfaces; - tissue engineering technologies thus producing biocompatible and bioresorbable hybrid bio-artificial tendon and ligament reconstruction devices which combine the advantages of the autograft technique without the delay of healing and the morbidity of donor site correlated with this approach. On the other hand this approach should overcome the limitations of the pure synthetic devices.  The composite devices will thus consist of: - HYAFF fibres (i.e. new bio-interactive Hyaluronic Acid-based polymers); - PolyLacticAcid fibres; - Hyaluronic Acid based matrix or coating (to guide cell attachment and in growth); - precursors of tendon/ligament cells. The biological and biomechanical properties of the devices will be carefully investigated in vitro and in small and large animal models and should be comparable with the original host structure.  An interactive loop device engineering-physico-mechanical characterisation-biological testing-device engineering will be balanced to ensure a progressive contribution to finer modifications of the device's attributes.

Climate change, and particularly any increase in average temperature and a shift in precipitation patterns, would probably accelerate that process many times. In the struggle land degradation and desertification, the major increases in our understanding of human-environmental relationships which have been achieved in the last fifteen years will be have to be mobilised to solve some of the many environmental problems which citizens of the Mediterranean Rim are experiencing. At present, there are still a number of obstacles in the way of an optimal use of the knowledge gathered. It is the contention of the authors of this proposal that the difficulties are in part due to the nature of the relationship between research and policy, and that a better mutual understanding between the two communities involved will have positive effects on the success rate. For this purpose, we propose in a Concerted Action to bring together a small mixed group of experts from the EU research community on land degradation and desertification with some members of the policy-making and -implementation community, as well as with experts from the policy research and sceince policy communities. This group will  1. identify issues and problems which render the generalisation of scientific observations, as well as the application and administration of policies, difficult and  2. investigate a number of substantive issues, such as the respective roles of policy and research, ways to improve their interaction, ways to write and implement policies which build on it, and ways to build a lasting bridge between the research and policy communities.  The interaction will be organized in three ""tasks"":  Task 1: The interface between the geosphere/biosphere and its end-users  Task 2: The interface between end-users and regional/local authorities  Task 3: The interface between regional/local authorities ans national/EU authorities  Each task consists of the organisation of a fruitful interaction beween the different kinds of experts concerned, which aims at inventorying  1. crucial issues at that level,  2. ways to formulate them,  3. the contribution of research to date (what policy-relevant research exists ?)  4. science policy, i.e. directions for future research, for example concerning the relation between existing policies ans their  perception by end-users,  5. ways to best focus such research, with particular attention to interdisciplinary interaction,  6. ways to integrate the results into policy decisions (the  construction of substantive policies),  7. ways to implement the policies thus designed Each task will result in a workshop and a publication (the deliverables)."
100|grant.3733193|BIO4986055; 45018|Trafficking pathways of normal and pathologic isoforms of the prion protein|Trafficking pathways of normal and pathologic isoforms of the prion protein|The appearance of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in Europe and its possible transmission to humans has put a priority on research on transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE). TSE are long known fatal neurodegenerative disorders of humans and animals that are characterized by dementia, motor dysfunction, and cerebral amyloidosis. These disorders are unique because they can be either infectious, genetic or sporadic in origin. All three forms result from a posttranslational alteration in the conformation of a host-encoded membrane glycoprotein called PrPc, which stands for the cellular isoform of the prion protein. Conversion of this normal isoform from an a-helical, readily proteolysed surface protein, to the scrapie isoform of PrP, PrPSc, a highly protease resistant, B-pleated sheet-containing hydrophobic aggregate is not only diagnostic of TSE infection, but is widely taken to be the defining infectious event and source of the subsequent neuropathology. Little is know about PrP which has a central role in TSE as demonstrated by the absolute relationship between PrP expression and development or transmission of TSE. Defining the mechanisms underlying the generation of prpSc from PrPc has now become one of the central issues in understanding the pathogenesis of prion diseases.   It is our contention that the conversion of prion protein from PrPc, to the pathogenic PrPSc, is strongly influenced by, and almost certainly requires, the normal trafficking of prion protein on cells. This perspective has important implications, not only for understanding the basic mechanism of the disease, but also for developing prophylactic and therapeutic measures, and for diagnosis. Despite the intense research interest in TSE, the cellular basis for the pathogenic conversion of PrP is an area that is relatively neglected, and many basic facts need to be established.   We propose here a coordinated effort to examine the trafficking of the different isoforms of PrP, in a cohesive strategy to understand the function and the pathogenic conversion of the protein. This project uniquely combines highly complementary and multi-disciplinary generic technologies of individual members with well characterized experimental systems. These technologies and systems comprise computer modeling, in-vitro system, functional assays and cell culture models, all of which in combination will allow us to examine the trafficking of normal and pathologic forms of PrP from synthesis to degradation.   Importantly, this proposal brings five groups that have not   previously worked oz TSE together with two more experienced groups in the field. This is a unique opportunity to join forces and benefit, on one hand, from the expertise of groups working previously on Alzheimer's Disease, protein modeling, cellular trafficking or glycolipids, and on the other hand, of well trained groups working on TSE.   The general measurable objectives of this proposal are: i) defining the biosynthetic pathways and maturation of PrP, ii) understanding the molecular basis of the endocytosis and recycling of the protein on the cell surface, iii) analyzing the proteolitic cleavage of PrP and its importance in the function and the conversion of the protein, and iv) examining the degradation of PrP in normal cells, and in cells infected with TSE. Achievement of the assigned objectives will generate comprehensive information about the fate of PrP in the cell and will lead to new strategies for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of TSE.

This will be measured using the most stringent assay available, namely the intra-cerebral inoculation of VM mice with protease-treated high-titre infectivity stocks obtained from a mouse-passaged strain of the most thermostable TSE variant reported BSE(301V).  Subsidiary objectives are:  - to show that effective inactivation can be achieved biologically at temperatures below the boiling point of water at atmospheric pressure - to show which classes and sources of thermostable protease are most appropriate for application with these agents  - the establishment and maintenance of a new breeding colony of VM mice as a resource for use in TSE research  - cloning and overexpression of genes encoding candidate proteases in heterologous mesophilic hosts enabling rapid large scale production and purification.  - to identify and purify candidate proteases for other industrial applications  Currently inactivation of TSE agents is an intractable problem, whether in medical or veterinary research, food handling and processing, or the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. A number of alternative solutions has been proposed and tested for this purpose. These range from chemical treatment, the use of elevated temperatures and pressures with wet heat, still higher extremes of dry heat, through to total incineration. Some chemical treatments have been shown to be ineffective (e.g. sodium hydroxide), others to be more effective but detrimental to equipment, machinery and the environment (e.g. sodium hypochlorite). Reproducible and validatable use of high temperatures and pressures requires specialised equipment, but may also be unreliable for inactivation. Incineration appears to be effective but also means that no recovery or reuse of raw materials or handling equipment can be achieved.  Reliable inactivation of TSE agents using highly thermostable proteases will be a major advance in several areas. For processes involving potentially infected animal materials (food, pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries) it will allow the safe recovery of non-proteinaceous components rather than their destruction. It will also permit the introduction of effective non-destructive disinfection cycles for most standard equipment used in handling and processing. In medical and veterinary applications, highly thermostable proteases will provide a research tool for the characterisation of causative agents of TSEs and allow a greater range of techniques to be used in their study, since dedicated equipment will not need to be destroyed after use.  The objectives of the project accord with several of the priority objectives identified in the programme work plan. The projects principal aim is to develop a biotechnological inactivation procedure for use in industry (theme 5:1). It will also have contributions to make in the characterisation of TSE agents (theme 1:1, theme 2:1, 2:3, 2.4).

The AMS-facility at Naples is in operation since many years, particularly for investigations . on the chronology of volcanic eruptions. However, precise data on the chronology of historical volcanic eruptions in . Campania are still needed. Furthermore no investigations on the time needed for the re-establishment of environmental . conditions allowing human re-settlement in sites interested by catastrophic eruptions have been performed up to now, although the AMS-technology allows to extract data with highly improved precision. The investigations mentioned above can not be performed using the AMS-system presently available at Naples: These studies demand for improved precision of the analyses as well as for higher throughput of samples to allow systematic studies. Significant technical improvements, i.e. implementation of a dedicated injection system and a fast cycling system, have to be made at the AMS-facility in order to meet these demands. The operation of the new injection system allows to optimise the AMS-system not only for the C14-method but also for different isotopes, such as 10Be and 26A1. The use of these isotopes in the Naples-AMS-facility may demonstrate the potential of AMS in a wide range of different research fields and applications. The research project aims at the technical improvement of the AMS-system at Naples. The applicant will invest his expertise on high voltage techniques and accelerator technology gained in university and industrial projects to implement these improvements under a definite time schedule and a duration of 1 year. Furthermore, systematic studies on the chronology of volcanic eruptions - demonstrating the improved AMS specifications - will be performed.  Training content (objective, benefit and expected impact)  - A training course for students with special emphasis on modern applications of ion accelerators in industry and research will be held during the research project. . - Training of young scientists in accelerator technology and in the use of ion beam analytical methods with special respect to . their use in industry will be accomplished. . - The results of the research project will be presented at international conferences; the industrial relevance will be evaluated . (see below). - The improved AMS-facility opens the window for new highly sensitive applications in different research fields, such as biomedical applications, archaeology, geology, volcanology, oceanography, semiconductor-technology, and environmental studies; these new applications are highly important for future activities at the university of Naples.  Links with industry / industrial relevance (22)  Since the number of applications of accelerator mass spectroscopy is presently significantly increasing, e.g. new biomedical applications, applications in environmental studies, the number of AMS-facilities is rising. The company High Voltage Engineering Europa (HVEE, Amersfoort, NL) is the only European manufacturer of AMS-systems.

The light hydrocarbon spills accumulate at the phreatic water table in the form of free (liquid) product. The contaminated sites are partly industrial plants (tar production, oil refinement), partly small enterprises (metal rectification, dry cleaning), but sometimes also due to massive bombing of industrial plants during world war 11.  Such LNAPLs hydrocarbons are usually volatile but relatively insoluble in water. Nevertheless, even at small concentrations they pose a risk to the consumability of water. Among others, major (toxic) components are light oil, gasoline/kerosene, PAHs, phenols, BTEX, and chlorinated hydrocarbons.  Different forces act on the LNAPLs and determine their fate in the soil environment:   - Organic phase transport  - Evaporation to the gas phase  - Dissolution in the water phase  - Sorption to the solid phase  - Degradation by microorganisms and enzymes   The specific problem arising from an oil phase floating on top of (unconfined) groundwater aquifers is the distnbution of the oil phase in the groundwater fluctuation zone. This leads to a vertical lubrication of the hydrocarbon phase, resulting in a drastic increase of the oil covered surface (oil-film formation) in the zone of water table fluctuation. This oil film not only is the source of a number of different contaminants but also changes almost all structural and functional properties of the aquifer.   The light hydrocarbons are generally (bio)degradable under aerobic conditions. Nevertheless, spills formed during the massive bombing of industrial plants during WWII, which may involve polluted areas of tens of km2, have been persistent against degradation until now. This suggests that the conditions at the contaminated layers are unfavourable for degradation.   The main objectives for the project group are   (i) to assess how large spills of LNAPLs behave in the subsurface strata in physical, chemical and biological respect,   (ii) to assess which conditions are favourable for extensive in situ biodegradation;   (iii) to investigate whether such favourable conditions can be created at actually contaminated sites with labour - and cost effective remediation strategies, i.e. natural attenuation, as intensive in situ bioremediation may not be achievable in view of the large areas and many sites involved;   iv) to quantify the release rate of the 'subsurface' contaminant source to the surroundings during extensive remediation, because of the hazard of further spreading of the contamination during the time span needed for degradation   The project will focus on light NAPL with major emphasis on natural attenuation or intrinsic bioremediation. The proposed research provides basic understanding of processes involved in extensive and passive remediation and gives guidelines to identify which combination of site parameters are likely to facilitate these options.  Furthermore, it provides the possibility to identify which factors constrain biodegradation and which actions may successfully remove these constraints. Therefore, the proposed research may improve the scientific and technological understanding of various in situ remediation management options, especially intrinsic bioremediation, and gives confidence in choosing for these options where these are applicable. This may improve cost effectiveness of in situ remediation and reduces the risk of adverse effects due to improperly choosing extensive or passive remediation as the option.
100|grant.3736660|BRPR970470; 38973; AIRDATA|Aircraft Drag And Thrust Analysis|Aircraft Drag And Thrust Analysis|Objectives and content  The industrial need for the proposed research in AIRDATA  arises from the fact that the European aircraft industry  demands new technologies to achieve high aerodynamic  efficiency and low fuel consumption for future aircraft.  One of the key aerodynamic technologies, for example  demanded by Airbus industries for the future A3XX-100 and  A3XX-200 aircraft projects, is engine/airframe  integration. The concept of new propulsion systems aims  at a higher total efficiency than the present-day  turbofan (TE;) engines. The greatest potential for  improving the total efficiency of engines is increasing  the fan by-pass ratio. This has led or will lead to the  categories of Very High Bypass Ratio engines (VHBR), with  by-pass ratios up to 9, and Ultra High Bypass Ratio  engines (UHBR), with by-pass ratios of 10 to 15.  Uninstalled VHBR/UHBR engines accomplish about 10% to 15%  fuel savings over that of conventional TF engines.  Currently ongoing research activities on this topic,  whether on a European level (e.g. ENIFAIR) or on a  national level, are insufficient. New research  initiatives are needed to achieve this higher level of  technology demanded by industry to launch new competitive  aircraft.  The industrial objective of AIRDATA is to develop,  evaluate, and validate CFD-based methods, which are  capable of predicting the aerodynamic interference  associated with engine/airframe integration. AIRDATA is  targeted to first time right aerodynamic design  procedures for future aircraft projects. This overall  industrial objective can be broken down into the  following technical, sub-objectives:   Improved flow modelling for thrust/drag analysis,  including CFD validation through comparison with ENIFAIR  wind tunnel data for models with turbine powered  simulators (TPS).   Demonstrate CFD grid optimisation, adaptation, and  extrapolation for engine/airframe integration.   Develop drag breakdown diagnostics capabilities to  achieve the higher level of technology as demanded for  future aircraft.   Provide new knowledge on thrust, drag, and drag  breakdown data for the ENIFAIR configurations at various  power settings, engine positions, and Mach numbers.  The expected achievements of the AIRDATA research include  optimal engine/airframe integration capabilities. These  new capabilities will allow the European aircraft  industry to fully optimise the aerodynamic performance of  new aircraft, yielding benefits in terms of increased  aerodynamic efficiency in combination with new, low fuel  consumption, engines.  AIRDATA is an initiative of a number of ENIFAIR partners  forming a new consortium. The AIRDATA consortium  consists of eight partners from three research  establishments (NLR, DLR, CIRA), three  airframe/engine/nacelle industries (BAe, Rolls-Royce,  Hurel-Dubois), one engineering company (Analytical  Systems Research), and one university (University of  Naples).

The effects of long term progestine treatment on the uterus will be studied in women receiving progestin therapy. The effects of short- and long-term estrogen and progestin administration will be studied in more detail by using experimental animals and the molecular basis of these effects will be studied in vitro in mammary gland- and uterus-derived cell lines and explant cultures. These studies aim to unravel the mechanism of the effects of estrogen and progestins in the uterus and the mammary gland. In addition, a development of a transgenic (gene ""knock out"") model for testing new progestins has been started. These mice express only one of the two progesterone receptor isoforms and will serve as models to study different and sometimes opposite effects of some synthetic progestins through these two different receptor isoforms. New progestins aiming at the establishment of progestins with narrow tissue specificity will be characterised in multiple in vitro and in vivo approaches. The aim will be a development of new tissue specific progestins which can oppose estrogen induced cell proliferation in the uterus, but which do not have proliferation stimulating effects in mammary gland.  Keywords: progestins, estrogen, hormone replacement therapy, mammary gland, endometrium, in vitro models, cell cycle, cell proliferation, apoptosis, carsinogenesis."

Review existing scientific knowledge, models, and databases which have or will become available from recent 'EC Environment Programme' projects in the Northern Mediterranean region.  2. Integrate the models and embed them in a spatial Decision Support System meant for integrated environmental policy making in the fields of Land Degradation, Desertification and Sustainable Water Management. This integration will result in a new powerful instrument, but it will add value to each of the constituting models equally well.  3. Involve, from the start and for the duration of the exercise, potential end-users from local planning and decision-making authorities in this process, to explore the wider range of issues that preoccupy the end users, and to include in the models policy indicators and variables that are considered relevant by the end users in their practical policy work.  4. Carry out end-user based trials of the Decision Support System and its models in the Argolid (Greece), and Marina Baja (Spain) regions in association with the local policy makers and other end-users, and with researchers working in these regions for different EU Environment programmes.  5. Deliver a decision tool which can be readily applied for   socio-environmental policy exercises in the case regions.  This tool pemits the user to access spatial, complex and state of the art knowledge about his region, and supports the design and evaluation of policy options in a novel and very user friendly manner.   The work involves three main steps:   1.The common elements of existing models which include aspects of the complex processes involved, need to be assessed. This activity will focus on:  - Reviewing the common elements of models developed under the recent EU Environment and Climate programmes for:    1. the estimation of runoff, sediment yield and aquifer recharge from hillslopes (including MEDALUS, EFEDA, MEDRUSH, EUROSEM, ERMES, and EROD for example);    2. the study of changing natural vegetation cover (ModMED, PATTERN);   3. the understanding of socio-economic land use changes (ARCHAEOMEDES). - Reviewing the models with a view to:    4. clarify modelling strategies as well as intentions and assumptions of models (Paradigm mapping);    5. compare the technical features of models, as the basis for integrative potential.   2. The best of the various models will be considered with a view to implementing them in the existing GriDSS Decision Support System, and ways will be identified to:   - better integrate and visualize the research results and models obtained so far,  - better link dynamic models of socio-economic and natural systems to existing and new GIS information;  - better integrate models that operate at different temporal and spatial scales;  - better exploit the research material in practical policy making; - run the models with the aim of exploring and evaluating possible management alternatives in terms of their level of effectiveness on the path towards sustainability.   3. To formally integrate the selected models within the GRIDSS Decision Support System. This will enable to work with integrated, dynamic (simulation) models linked to realistically represent the many coupled processes, both human and natural, all acting upon the system at different spatial and temporal scales.  It will be made flexible and adaptable in nature, in order for it to be applicable in different situations and in different locations prone to or subject to land degradation and desertification.   4. After implementation of the models for both regions, the prototypes will be applied, tested and evaluated on actual policy problems in collaboration with the end-users.

While advances have been made, osteogenesis is still limited and ultrastructural studies indicate incomplete integration for most implant systems. This proposal presents novel surface bioactivation procedures to improve the osteointegrative properties of mechanically suited biomaterials. It specifically directs towards porous biomaterials formulated to create phospholipid-rich microenvironments, which will induce calcium phosphate deposition and encourage collagen mineralisation.  Candidate systems will be developed from titanium/hydroxyapatite-coated alloys and novel acrylate co-polymers. Material surfaces will be modified to offer controlled surface porosity; phospholipid- coating approaches will draw upon formulation methodologies already successfully applied in pharmaceutical development. Deposition of calcium-binding phospholipids or entrapment of calcium-permeable liposomes in biomaterial pores will achieve surface bioactivation. Localisation of calcium within, or influx into, a phosphate-rich interior will result in calcium phosphate deposition in the pores with consequent matrix mineralisation; a process reflective of the physiological role played by membrane vesicles during bone regeneration. In a second approach, porous polymer surfaces will be functionalised by copolymerisation with phosphate-ester based methacrylate monomers. Each pore will represent a microenvironment capable of creating a calcium-rich layer favouring osteoblast integration and mineralisation. Biomimetic bioactive phospholipid-based porous matrices will provide options for coating and monolith technologies offering improved osteointegration properties BE97-4384.

It is now well understood that socioeconomic impact triggers degradation processes by imposing disturbances in the complex interactions of physiographic factors like plant growth, soil formation, water availability and erosion processes. The first theoretical assumption behind this proposal is that the understanding of ecosystems changes, needs to be based on the analysis of vegetation dynamics as it is plant cover which protects the soil from erosion and determines ecosystems functions. The second assumption is that computer based simulation modelling is now generally recognized as a very important tool in ecological research. It must be recognized that below ground processes represent a big hole in the current knowledge and yet they fit very clearly into the framework of desertification research established over the last decade. This study will try to be cutting new ground by addressing these problems, but starting from the strenght of established results. The following will be the specific tasks to be achieved: Modelling work will implement a new modelling environment and new models of plant community dynamics including below-ground processes and roots on the base of existing simulation software (Modmed II project). At the individual plant level ecophysiological studies will be performed on biomass allocation carbon and nitrogen partitioning. At the plant community level information will be collected on seed bank, seedling establishment, and below-ground structures and processes. At the vegetation landscape level pedoanthracological analysis will extend the historical analysis of vegetation changes and satellite remote sensing work will implement the spatial scaling up of the vegetation landscape analysis from the study sites to regional level. Both a better ecological understanding and the availability of reliable models are necessary for scientists in order to suggest proper environmental management of Mediterranean ecosystems and to predict the effects of different land use practices. This complies with the general objective of the Environment and Climate Programme and also with the required improvement of communication between environmental science and policy as recently addressed by the International Desertification Conference held in Crete in November 1997.

TSH acts through a serpentine receptor which has been shown to couple with the heterotrimeric G-proteins Gs, Gq, Gi, G12 and G13 and to activate two main intracellular effectors: cAMP and the proto-oncogene Ras. Recently, G-protein coupled receptors have been shown to regulate cell morphology, growth, survival and transformation through the activation of specific heterotrimeric G-proteins. Depending on the G-protein coupled, distinct signal transduction pathways can be activated. It has been shown that tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins (paxillin, p130Cas, pl25FAK, src), kinase activity of pl25FAK, src, P13K PKC and activation of Ras family GTP-binding proteins (Ras, Rho, Rac and CDC42) can be stimulated through G-protein coupled receptors. Interestingly, these substrates have been shown to be activated and control critical molecular events in signal transduction pathways involved in the action of integrins, growth factor receptors and oncogenes. With this project we plan to identify new signalling components which can be involved in transduction pathways regulating thyroid cell growth through the activation of TSH receptor. We plan to elucidate the molecular events involved in Ras activation following TSH stimulation. In particular, we aim to examine tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins (paxillin, pl30Cas, Shc, p125FAK, src) in response to TSH and whether these substrates are involved in formation of molecular complexes with signalling and adaptor proteins (Grb2, Crk) following TSH-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. We plan to explore also the role of Rho, PI3K and PKC in TSH receptor signalling and to study the involvement of these signalling proteins in Ras activation and cell proliferation of TSHstimulated thyroid cells. Training Content (objective benefit and expected impact)  This project aims to identify new molecular targets in thyroid tumorigenesis whlch could be of potential use in cancer therapy. The practical experience and scientific knowledge that I have gained during my previous position will help in As a result of this, fresh ideas and technologies will be imported in a less-favoured region of the Community and new scientific collaborations will also be initiated.

100|grant.3747837|FAIR973525; 48068|Optimising biological control of a dominant weed in major crops|Optimising biological control of a dominant weed in major crops|Objectives of the proposed research are to optimise biological control the weed fat-hen (Chenopodium album) in maize, sugar beet and cabbage crops by applying the fungus Ascochyta caulina as a microbial herbicide, and to integrate biological control in traditional weed management systems.   Fat-hen is the most abundant and one of the most competitive weeds in Europe. Substantial reductions of herbicides are possible if this weed can be controlled biologically. Considerable progress in the biological of fat-hen by Ascochyta caulina has already been made. Under appropriate field conditions, the fungus kills 60-70 % of young seedlings, and substantially reduces regrowth of surviving plants. Related crop plants are not attacked.   For practical application, two major challenges remain: to increase the activity of the fungus on fat-hen for sufficient activity in less competitive crops (e.g. sugar beet), and the activity should vary less with outside weather conditions. Four research tasks were formulated to increase the activity, of Ascochyta caulina, to reduce its dependency on environmental conditions, and one to implement biological control in traditional weed control systems. To increase the activity of Ascochyta caulina, the genetic variation in virulence of the fungus will fully explored by searching and testing new isolates throughout Europe. To ascertain that selected isolates will be active under different climatic conditions and in a range of different crops in Europe, the activity of the most promising novel isolates will be tested under different environmental conditions and plant developmental stages. Specific attention will be given to improve the reliability of Ascochyta caulina under relatively dry conditions. The requirements to overcome the dependency on high air humidity will be met by adequate formulation and optimising spraying techniques. The 2-3 most promising new isolates of Ascochyta caulina will be tested in major crops in different regions of Europe, in combination with traditional measures to control the other weeds in these crops.   It is expected that, based on the results, the private industry involved in this project, will further develop and commercialise Ascochyta caulina into a microbial herbicide.

This Project, through a collaboration of five national research groups, addresses the objectives of the TSER Workprogramme in Area II (2.3.5, 1.2.1, 2.3.2) concerning the capacity for change and adaptation to innovation of a crucial sector of the education system - science education and is also relevant to Area I (1.2.4, 1.2.1) concerning ""Information society: assessment of individual and societal needs for information and knowledge, within the bullet point: The impact of innovation and the diffusion (of technologies). This is the nature of the transversality of the project.   In our proposal, two issues are specially relevant having in mind a society where a large amoullt of information comes to each citizen easily and quickly:   a) The need of mastery of technological tools and of interpreting many messages cannot be easily acomplished for many learners. Basic scientific education is a privileged* context to achieve this goal and consequently the need to prepare adequately future science teachers is of high priority.  b) The great amount of information received has to be well managed for each citizen. As information is selected prioritised, interpreted and decisions based on it are taken, the act of understanding is always transformative.  The process of transformation of information by users is still poorly known but thousands of decisions are taken with the interpreted information as well students learning according to their interpretation of messages. We wish to investigate the process of transformation in a very specific field since we can go deeper and better gain knowledge when reducing variables*. In our case the transformations of the intentions of designers of innovations are the crucial point. We will infer rules of transformation of information from results of small scale intensive studies.   Science teachers at Secondary school will be investigated during the implementation of 3 process of innov:   - process of implementing the use of several technological tools  - process of adapting to students' interpretations of different symbolic language   - process of implementing new teaching strategies proposed in specific subject matters.   The results got from teachers at secondary school in 5 countries will be able to be compared since there is agreement between partners about the approach, the topics, the informatic tools, and the representations. Some rulles of transformation of innov. will emerge having removed the context dependency as a variable.   The main envisaged tasks are:   - Analysis of teachers' difficulties in:   - implementation of innovative teaching strategies; use of symbolic languages; use of Information Technology tools.   - Diagnosis and synthesis of difficulties in assuming innovation into school practice.   - Construction and evaluation of strategies and materials for training programs for teacher trainers.   - ldentifying rules of transformation of innovations operating in the context of school innovation, but with implications for other kinds of innovation (e.g. managerial)   - Elaboration of guidelines for policy makers, teacher training agencies and diffusion agencies in order that can decide more adequate policies of training or dissemination of information.   Practical and theoretical products are expected. The main practical products, with a focus on information Technology based tools, will be materials for teacher training in innovative educational strategies and materials for teacher training programmes for teacher trainers. The theoretical products will be, at a conceptual level an inventory of the main problems of adaptation between innovations and teachers and, as an outcome recommendations and guidelines for policy makers and training and diffusion agencies. As Science Education researchers we can contribute from multiple points of attack: familiarity with the use of new technologies, habitual use of many ways to display information (data, process, concepts), expertise in analysing difficulties in understanding, experience in dealing with teacher training interventions.   The expertise of the researchers of the team is a warranty of the quality of the research. Also the experience in management of the coordinator assures good administration of the resources and the achievement of the plan."

The general aims of PLAN include: - to provide the opportunity to organise regular meetings, workshops, seminars and conferences at which key research issues can be discussed by both contractors and customers leading to improved work specification; - to secure added value by organising the individual projects and co-ordination their research into dedicated research clusters and horizontal themes; - to achieve teamwork by the networking principle, enabling efficient technology and innovation transfer between different partners and industries and cross fertilisation and dissemination of results to a wider audience; - to exchange high level technical information thereby creating an exploitation environment and improved awareness to influence the drafting of European codes and standards; - to provide a contribution from over 50 Projects representing many hundred predominantly industrial organisations towards the future shaping of European Union research priorities and activities in the area of plant life assessment.  EUROPEAN DIMENSION AND PARTNERSHIP: The benefits to Europe and industry include, amongst others; - heightened awareness of research and development activities within industries; - the EC becoming a more informed customer; - a contribution to safer and more reliable plant; - improved communication between industries;; - working with new partners from diverse industries; - the opportunity to draw up a list of key personnel in the European engineering industry which will be one of the horizontal themes; - the opportunity to draw up a technical route map for the research activities within EC SCA that should make the programme more user friendly and the results more readily disseminated into guides, criteria, codes and standards.  POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS: The Plant Life Assessment Network is multi-sectoral and multi- disciplinary with a generic relevance for industry, with its participants representing most industrial sectors covering the power generation, chemical and petrochemical, manufacturing and transport industries and addressing a range of problems relating to plant life assessment and management. The engineering sector and in particular structural integrity has a large impact on society not only in terms of employment but also in relation to the living, working environment and protection from man made disasters. Engineering failures in the power, chemical and transport industries can have a major impact on society, directly in terms of injury, loss of life and environmental damage as well as indirectly on confidence and economy. It has been suggested that the life expectation of important structural and pressure part components would be increased if existing knowledge and proper application of instruments and monitoring technologies in the manufacturing and processing industries can give further rise to the efforts in arriving at more efficient production systems, less resource demanding and with a higher quality of the resulting output. In conclusion it can be argued that the network PLAN can make a contribution towards the safe life and availability of important structural components.

100|grant.3731772|BRRT975016; 39947; ENOVNET|European noise and vibration network|European noise and vibration network|ENOVNET  PROJECT OVERVIEW   The ENOVNET Network covers the RDT activities related to  techniques and technologies aimed at noise and Vibration  Control for all industrial and environmental sectors.  Noise (and Vibration) has been for a long time a major  parameter of the evaluation of the quality of the living  environment.  In the last 30 years, scientists and technicians have achieved significant progress in the understanding of the noise source mechanisms in the propagation of noise and finally in the  evaluation of the effects of noise exposure on public health. The actual applications of these scientific and technical  achievements have not yet reached their full potential for many reasons among which :  * the lack of coordination between the industrial partners,  * the discrepancies between the countries/organisations,  * the absence of overall review on match between research  and actual industrial needs.  This network will :  - improve the synergies between the participants, within and around the Consortia,  - facilitate technology transfer,  - speed up exploitation and diffusion of results,  - strengthen the generic character of these technologies.   EUROPEAN DIMENSION AND PARTNERSHIP   The general idea of establishing operational networking on the generic technical/industrial and social issues of Noise and  Vibration Control is essential :  * for the cohesion of the EC policy in social (health) and  environment protection.  * for the validation of the available expertise in  scientific and technological issues  * for the emergence of a more complete set of common:   - standardisation of products, testing and procedures  (suppliers - customers)   - certification of the major operators,   - qualification.  All Europeans share a table common type of living environment. Noise is playing a major role in this, whether for the  acceptability of individual products or overall systems (like transport). There are no borders in this domain. Kit is an area where a common approach will contribute to the enhancement of the European population and society cohesion  The ENOVNET encompasses Universities, Research Organisation, Industrial Manufacturers, Environmental Protection Agencies, ...   POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS   For the industry, availability of products, procedures and a complete regulatory environment will enable the development of high quality output (from housing to trains, aircraft, cars, machine-tools, electrical appliances, power generation, etc.). This is going to be a major competitiveness factor; it can be already seen today that high added value products hold a very favourable competitive edge over the rest of the market.  The main beneficiaries will be :  * the housing/construction sector where noise environment  and comfort will be greatly enhanced,  * the transport industries (rail, road, air, sea) with all  their equipment suppliers (mostly SMEs),  * the electrical goods industry (household equipment, hand  power tools ....),  * the materials industry (mainly acoustic materials and  composites) a with a large impact   on SMEs.  One important aspect of the TN exploitation will also be the development of new types of training.

It is presently the main bacterial disease of crops produced in nurseries in Mediterranean countries. The long term objective of the project is to decrease the prevalence of crown gall in nurseries to below a reasonable threshold providing substantial incomes to growers. This objective will be achieved by the development of new sanitary practices based on epidemiology, biocontrol and genetic control. As a specific objective, the scientists plan to establish a common set of standardized procedures to detect, identify and monitor the fate of the causative agent and to critically view the methods that could be used to control crown gall disease. Expected Outcome  The work carried out in this project should provide : 1. The most important collection of Agrobacterium isolated in standardised conditions in six countries around the Mediterranean Sea; this will furnish useful data about the epidemiology of Agrobacterium as well as strains belonging to new types of agrobacteria and pTi. 2. Tools for phytosanitary inspection procedures to lower pathogenic populations will be evaluated and delivered. 3. Extended and integrated use of efficient biocontrol agents on major crops as well as resistance assessment of commercially important material. The key activities envisaged are : * Isolation, identification, detection and quantification of numerous pathogenic agrobacteria in various crops to study the origin and fate of agrobacterial populations within and between different crops and countries. * Accurate characterisation of bacterial strains by PCR, RFLP, AFLP, sequencing and DNA hybridization will be conducted at both chromosomal and pTi levels by using ribosomal and vir and T-DNA regions respectively. This should lead to the discovery of new agrobacteria and pTi encoding for the biosynthesis of new opine compounds. Persistence of agrobacteria in plants and soil, including study of the stability and dispersion of the pTi, will be experimentally evaluated. * Evaluation of procedures (sanitary practices, solarisation, heat treatments, etc.) to lower pathogenic populations in plant and soil reservoirs. * Development of biological, genetical and physiological controls, including : testing efficiency of available biocontrol agents (K84), method to screen biocontrol efficiency in plant, and screening of new biocontrol agents; searching for intrinsic resistance among cultivars; and evaluating the control efficiency of compounds extracted from weeds.

The experimental research will concentrate on a series of newly synthesized HM polyelectrolytes with well controlled degree of hydrophobicity prepared from natural polysaccharide chitin or its deacetylated form chitosan. The pliarity of such chitin derivatives is the possibility to influence their hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance both by varying the fraction and the chain length of hydrophobic stituents and by ionization of repeat units. The effect of polymer concentration, degree of hydrophobicity (which can be varied by changing the fraction and the chain length of hydrophobic n-alkyl groups), degree of ionization, ionic strength, temperature and shear rate on the physico-chemical properties of HM polysaccharides in aqueous solution (aggregation, gelation and phase separation) will be considered. Along with traditional rheological investigation of associating polymers, a particular attention will be paid to the development of the relationships between mollar mechanism of aggregation and macroscopic associative behaviour, utilizing techniques including light scattering, nuclear magnetic resonance, fluorescent probe method, small-angle X-ray scattering, calorimetry, tensiometry etc. This will permit to better understand physico-chemical mechanisms of aggregation and gelation playing an important role in the unfolding of numerous technological processes.

During the recent earthquakes of Northridge and Kobe an unexpected brittle failure of connections and, in same cases, of members occurred. This means that something new happened, which was not foreseen in the current engineering practice. For this reason, the international scientific community and, in particular, the earthquake prone countries of the Mediterranean area and of the eastern Europe are aware of the urgent need to review the current seismic provisions. They feel the need to investigate new topics such as the influence of the strain rate on the cyclic behavior of beam-to-column joints. In addition, the whole background of modern seismic codes deserves to be completely reviewed in order to grasp the design rules which failed during the last terrible seismic events.  The aim of the joint research programme, here proposed, is to provide an answer to the above questions. This task will be accomplished through the following objectives :  * analysis and synthesis of research results, including Code Provisions, in relation with the evidence of Northridge and Kobe earthquakes. Particular attention will be devoted also to those research results which have not accounted for in preparing the provision of modern seismic codes. * assessment of new criteria for selecting the behavior factor for different structural typologies and definition of the corresponding range of validity. In particular, in this field, the need to provide simplified methods for evaluating the q-factor is felt more and more urgent. The aim is to provide the designer with an operative tool which allows him to be aware of the inelastic performances of the designed structure. * identification and evaluation of the structural characteristics of connections influencing the seismic response of steel buildings. Therefore, the research will be devoted to the strength and stiffness evaluation of moment resistant connections and to the prediction of their degradation under cyclic loads. Low cycle fatigue will also be investigated. * definition of criteria for designing and detailing beam-to-column connections for seismic resistant structures, considering also the seismicity of the site.  These objectives will be accomplished through the following tasks : analysis of design criteria and seismic hazard, evaluation of the material behavior in extreme conditions, ductility demand of members and connections, evaluation of the behavior factor, reliable models for the cyclic behavior of connections, interaction between local and global ductility, failure mode and ductility control, preparation of an Application Document.

The need for better economics, higher productivity,  environment protection and more efficient and safe  operations pushed the oil and gas industry towards the  development of novel drilling and completion  technologies, like slimhole, coiled tubing and high  precision plug operations. However, due to lack of  adequate cementing materials and placement techniques,  overall success and safety of cementing in these  operations is limited (30% for plugs) or cannot be  guaranteed (slimhole, coiled tubing).  Oil and gas companies have, therefore, a strong need to  extend current cementing technology in terms of  formulations and implementation techniques, in order to  take full advantage of the underlying benefits in costs  reduction, increased operations efficiency, productivity  and environmental impact. Manufactures and service  companies that perform cementations are forced to react  on new tendencies and developments, in order to be able  to provide materials and services with the necessary  properties and quality.  The objective of the project is to develop adequate  formulations for application of the aforementioned  technologies from 3 alternative chemical systems:  thermoset resins, mud cement systems and ultra fine  cements. For all 3 systems, selection and formulation  will be based on commercially viable materials having  favorable environmental characteristics relative to  toxicity, bioaccumulation and biodegradation. This  ensures the potential for application of project  deliverables in Denmark, Norway and the UK (North Sea  sectors) as well as world wide.  The final results will offer a range of technical  solutions in terms of cementing materials and procedures,  as well as rules for appropriate selection for given  operational conditions (depth, bottomhole temperature,  reservoir pressure, wellbore geometry). Results will  serve as a basis to create new standards and recommended  practices on cementing for the novel drilling  technologies. Significant progress is also expected in  remedial jobs in old wells and different areas of civil  and environmental engineering, like grouting and sealing  of waste/refuse dumps.  A balanced and complementary partnership was obtained,  involving 4 EU countries. It comprises  four big oil and gas companies that are directly  involved with the whole range of applications of the  novel drilling and completion technologies,  a major service company with advanced knowledge in  well servicing operations  a manufacturer strongly involved with  commercialization of high added value cementing products,  a research center and a university, both of world wide  reputation and expertise.  Besides expertise on formulation of drilling fluids,  cements and resins for severe application conditions, the  research center has develop analytical techniques (SEM,  NMR, X ray diffraction) to characterise structure  evolution in reactive materials. The university is  specialised in the experimental and theoretical  characterisation of the polymerisation reaction in  resins. The manufacturer is particularly active in the  research of innovating materials. The oil & gas  companies and the service company have advanced  complementary laboratory techniques to evaluate cement  quality (slurry characteristics, mechanical properties,  interface binding quality) under severe bottomhole  conditions.  The total budget is of 1.74 million ECU (126 manmonths)  and the duration of 28 months.  Companies of the project cover an important part of the  European oil and gas industry. Participation of the  service company will ensure efficient dissemination and  exploitation of results in Europe and world wide. It is  expected that results of this project will be available  for industrial use within 12 to 16 months after the  termination of the project.

Materials and processes to realize these alternative encapsulations are the objectives of the project. The state-of the -art encapsulation which is presently used for CIS (CuInSe2) as well as for CdTe (and aSi) modules will be the standard all the new encapsulants to be developed will be compared with. The specifications to be met are given in the international standard IEC 1646.   TECHNICAL APPROACH   The approach of the proposed project is to use a conformal coating which allows continuous processes, reduces weight and energy consumption. There are several possible alternatives :  - Organic-inorganic nanocomposites and laminated coatings for long term corrosion and mechanical protection of CIS and CdTe solar modules - Organic coatings formed by plasmapolymerisation  - Polymeric organic coatings deposited from solutions and suspensions - Conformal coating with parylene, a polymer substance used in electronics as one of the best conformal coatings for components and printed circuit boards - High-rate plasma deposition of inorganic compounds with known barrier properties as they are used in the microelectronics and display industry : silicon oxide and nitride, glasses like PSG and BPSG, also including graded coatings.  It is also intended to combine two or more of these layers to form layered structures or to combine the described layers with plastic or glass foils resp. to form multiple layers to combine the properties of the single coatings and to adapt the properties of the modules to specific applications.  EXPECTED ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPLOITATION PLANS   After successful completion of the project the partners will be able to produce low-cost thin-film solar modules based in CIS and CdTe-technology, which will be stable enough for the major part of applications. Due to the lower production costs the alternative encapsulation technology will help to proliferate photovoltaics in the future. there is also an exploitation potential outside PV since hermetic coatings are required in electronics, sensor technology and others.

The thyroid gland is particularly prone to autoimmune disease and it is known that exposure to radiation induces thyroiditis. The relationship between stimulation of the immune system in response to novel antigens associated with neoplasia and carcinogenesis is unclear. It was generally thought that stimulation of the immune response led to the production of a destructive infiltrate in the tumor, but recent evidence suggests that tumor lymphoid infiltrates may also produce factors which stimulate tumor cell growth. There has been a large increase in the numbers of thyroid carcinomas in children exposed to fallout from Chernobyl, in particular in papillary carcinomas. This morphological type of thyroid tumor is more commonly associated with thyroiditis than other types of thyroid tumor. No study has so far been made specifically of lymphoid infiltration in childhood thyroid cancer, nor of a comparison of tumors that are related to radiation exposure and those not associated with radiation exposure.  The objectives of this study are therefore to :  describe and quantify the tumor associated lymphoid infiltrate and correlate its frequency with the morphological type of tumor in patients from areas exposed to allout from Chernobyl and with age and sex matched patients with no known radiation exposure; carry out analysis of the lymphocytic infiltrate within tumors to examine local production of factors known to be growth stimulatory to thyroid epithelial cells; correlate the presence and type of lymphoid infiltrate with mutations in key thyroid oncogenes (ras, ret, and the TSH receptor).  These studies will require access to pathological material from children and adolescents with thyroid cancer from the areas exposed to fallout from Chernobyl, and the classification of the morphological types of tumor present. The study will be carried our on thyroid cancers occurring in patients born between 1976 and 1989 inclusive, so that it includes the recently identified most sensitive cohort, and also a group born after the accident, who would not have been exposed to radioiodine. It will also require access to thyroid tissue from non neoplastic thyroidectomies from exposed areas, and to thyroid cancers and non neoplastic thyroidectomies from unexposed patients.

Our aim is to understand exactly how the virus initiates infection of its target cell and how it interfers with the workings of the host cell to cause disease. HCV is a major cause of serious liver disease. It is estimated that approximately 200 million people globally are infected with this virus, a significant number of whom will go on to develop serious liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Current worldwide projections estimate that HCV in particular will be a major source of morbidity and mortality before the end of this decade. Although new promising treatments are now becoming available, there are many unmet needs and there is as yet no vaccine available. Therefore, basic research on viral proteins to enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of virus infection is needed to develop better anti-viral therapies. Our investigations of the functions and structures of the relevant virus and host proteins will allow better understanding of the processes involved in virus life cycle and disease. The information gained will be crucial in developing novel antiviral drugs and vaccines.  Technical Summary Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease that often leads to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Promising new treatments are now becoming available, but they are focused on one viral genotype. There are many unmet needs and therefore HCV will remain a serious threat for the foreseeable future. There is as yet no vaccine available. To develop new targets for a broad and more effective therapy, and preventative vaccines, it is necessary to gain greater insights into the processes involved in virus life cycle and their effects on cellular metabolism.  Our research is focused on investigating the mechanisms of HCV entry into target cells and the interactions between viral and cellular components involved in virus life cycle and pathogenesis. Specifically, we have been studying virus neutralizing antibodies and their mode of action both at structural and functional level, modes of virus transmission in cultured cells, and the functional significance of the interaction between the HCV core protein and host factors. Closely aligned to the above work, we have (1) developed several robust cell-based high-throughput screening assays that have enabled us to identify novel anti-viral compounds targeting different stages of the virus life-cycle and (2) an on-going translational project on the development of antibody-based vaccine against HCV. My group is a member of the Glasgow HCV Network (a consortium of clinicians and scientists) and a national consortium called HCV Research UK focused on fundamental research, clinical studies and translational approaches on HCV. Our aim is to investigate molecular mechanisms that contribute to HCV-associated pathogenesis. The work performed under this programme includes whole genome transcriptome analysis in diseased liver, and investigating host factors that determine viral clearance or progression to chronicity and extrahepatic disorders. In addition, we are studying the interaction between HCV core and the cellular DEAD-box protein, DDX3. Our data show that this interaction is dispensable for virus life cycle, but may be involved in apoptosis, oncogenesis and aspects of innate immunity. We also find that DDX3 interacts with a variety of cellular factors involved in host RNA metabolism thus implicating the core-DDX3 interaction in these processes, which may in turn contribute to viral pathogenesis. We are investigating the mechanisms for the sequestration of the host factors and their functions in infected cells. Identification of functional pathways is likely to provide novel targets for pharmacological intervention and treatment of HCV-related diseases.

A 3 - 4 MWTH fuel input system for straw with high inorganic ash content (straw with 4 - 6% ash content) will be designed, built and tested for at least 100 hours based on a combination of laboratory experiments and engineering know-how. Components for a full scale system - 30 - 50 MWTH - will be designed and a systems synthesis for 3 different European countries, including environmental aspects for the emission of solids (ash/particles), liquids (water soluble minerals) and gases (especially NOX), will be prepared.    Technical Approach   The core of the process is a specially designed reactor tube, where compressed - cut - straw during axial transport are subjected to radially introduced gasification mediae (air or mixture of air and flue gases) at an elevated temperature. The ensuing pyrolysis and charring processes are controlled at a temperature level (in the range 400 - 600OC), where chlorine compounds are retained in a solid phase. The pyrolytic gases and the solid phase are subsequently separated (a mixture of approximately 50% gas and 50% char - calorifically - is expected) and the solid phase - after a washing operation (to remove inorganic compounds - 80% removal is foreseen) - is finally burned with the pyrolytic gases in a specially designed combustion system. Therefore, the resulting flue gases after combustion will basically be clean and suitable for heating stand alone power boilers and also for biomass cofiring with fossile fuel in central power plants.   The gasifier and associated feeding system and the combustor will be tested in a pilot plant and software for the simulation of the reactor and burner will be developed. The design of the particle separation system will be based on existing engineering knowhow and experiences and the basic data for the char washing system will be developed in the laboratory.    Expected achievements and exploitation   After completion of the project, it is expected, that the basic information necessary to continue with a full scale demonstration will be available. This could take place in a cooperation with the danish power utilities ELSAM, which were involved in a previous feasibility study concerning this technology, and which will be kept informed on the progress of the current project. The potential for using the technology seems very large, and may be the only possibility of utilizing large amounts of biomass in connection with both central and decentral power production. The industrial partners in the project all have significant positions in the electro-mechanical industry and exploitation of this technology will be fully inside the partners core businesses.

To achieve this objective, the Guadiana river basin has been selected as the pilot area. The Guadiana basin has a wide range of troubles that cover several fields: administrative, socioeconomic, environmental, hydrologic and hydrogeologic. For this reason, the application that will be developed, will be susceptible to be extrapolated to other river basins.

This will be obtained by conferring the therapeutic potential of well known non-human antitumor ribonucleases, such as the bovine and the amphibian enzymes mentioned above, to human ribonucleases devoid of antitumor action. A non-cytotoxic human ribonuclease is already available in one of the proposers' laboratory, and its cDNA has been cloned and expressed. Through mutagenesis and engineering of the DNA coding for this inactive human ribonuclease, recombinant mutant proteins will be obtained with the structural features essential for exerting an antitumor action. The production of the engineered proteins will be followed by the determination of their biological properties, and the mutants with the highest antitumor action will be analysed by NMR for the determination of their structures. This will in turn direct the programming of second generation mutants.  DNA and protein engineering will be carried out by the proponent from Italy; the antitumor and biological assays will be performed by the proponent from the Czech Republic; the determinations of RNase mutant structures by NMR will be carried out by the Spanish proponent, while the Hungarian proponent will promote innovative NMR methodologies for the analysis of the dynamics of RNases.  The success of the experimental approach we propose is very probable, as in the laboratory of one of the proponents has been already demonstrated that a biologically inactive ribonuclease can be transformed by directed mutagenesis in an antitumor ribonuclease. Furthermore, the work will be judiciously distributed among the different groups, each already well established in its respective scientific field. The aim of the research as proposed is to produce a ribonuclease(s) which can be effectively and safely employed in tumor therapy. This will be carried out by applying basic as well as advanced biotechnology methodologies and innovative therapeutic ideas.  The first original observation on the antitumor action of a ribonuclease has been obtained in the laboratory of one of the proponents, working with bovine seminal ribonuclease. The laboratories of two of the proponents have been active for years in the chemical and biological characterization of this enzyme, a very effective antitumor and antimetastatic agent, for which some of the structural determinants essential for the antitumor action have been already defined. However, a biotech firm in the U.S.A. has obtained in the last few years a headstart in the general field of antitumoral RNases with a ribonuclease from an amphibian source, which has been recently admitted to Phase III clinical trials. This has been mainly due to the attention of the American general public and of the economic market to innovative research in medicine. Thus the exploitation of the expertise and of the research data already available to the proponents from EU and CCE countries undoubtedly merits the attention of the EC as a funding institution.

This is best achieved by making grain legume production more efficient and competitive. Fungal pathogens impose inefficiences on grain legume production through both direct damage to crops and the requirement for fungicides. Transformation technology in legumes has now advanced to the stage where applications can now be considered. It is proposed to build new pathogen resistance into the major European grain legumes and to test the effectiveness in biomclecular, glasshouse and field tests. Genes for three types of potentially useful anti-fungal plant-derived proteins will be introduced into the major European grain legumes. These three types are: the gene for the phytoalexin-synthesising enzyme stilbene synthase; the gene for an inhibitor of an important cell wall degrading enzyme of fungal pathogens, polygalacturonase inhibiting protein (PGIP); and a combination of the genes for osmotin and endo-chitinase. Additional genes are available to the participants and will be used if the progress of the work allows. These genes will be driven by suitable promoters and transformants will be screened for stable integration and suitable levels of expression. The efficiency of transformation methods will be compared and the best one selected to permit the generation of sufficient transformants to be screened for expression levels. Studies will be made on the effect of the expression of these transgenes on major pathogens of peas, faba beans, chickpeas and lupins. These pathogens will include Botrytis species in all four grain legume crops, and species of the Ascochyta complex and the foot and root rot complex in the first three crops. The effects of transgene expression will be studied at three levels. Fungal growth in infected tissues will be quantified rapidly using ELISA; whole plant tests in containment will be performed by commercial breeders; and field trials will be made by a consortium of breeders to test effectiveness against selected pea pathogens in a field experiment."

The project will assess the feasibility of protecting crops from insect attacks by expressing naturally occurring insect signaling peptides in plants. Modern agriculture faces the challenge to secure the food supply in an environmentally compatible manner. Weeds, diseases and pests are among the most serious problems threatening the production of a successful harvest. The tools at the disposal of the farmer to combat insects include adapted crop varieties and pest management programmes. Breeding for insect resistant crop varieties is often hampered by a lack of resistance alleles present in the germplasm. The use of chemical insecticides (and pesticides in general) is more and more criticized because of potential environmental problems which may accrue. Biological control with baculovirus, bacteria, fungi or parasitic wasps, represents less than 1% of the chemical insecticide sales and only finds application in specific circumstances. Bacillus thuringiensis toxins are now widely used. However, the major threat to the Bt-plant technology, although very successful at this moment, is the potential of insect populations to develop resistance (Van Rie et al., 1995). It is now the right time to proceed with the research to find novel insecticidal toxins as alternatives for Bt-toxins when Bt-resistance would become a major problem. In this project we propose to explore an alternative approach for generating insect tolerant crops varieties. Since 1985, insect physiologists have discovered about 100 different insect signaling peptides. We have identified a set of such peptides which we think to have the potential to become a new class of insecticides. These peptides control different physiological processes, such as inhibition of ecdysone synthesis, inhibition of juvenile hormone synthesis, stimulation of cardiac muscle activity, inhibition of gut motility, etc. The development of insects exposed to such peptides in unphysiological dosages or at unusual times is dramatically disturbed and can lead to growth inhibition and death. The question is of course whether peptides can survive in the gut environment, pass through the gut wall, enter the hemolymph and still maintain their biological activity. A few papers showing that this is indeed the case have already been published. In this project we propose to: 1. study and select signaling insect peptides which enter the hemolymph upon oral administration, 2. design and synthesize peptide analogous for improved stability and gut transition, 3. improve the already realised expression in tomatoes of a synthetic gene coding for the insect peptide proctolin and realise the poexpression of the allatostatin gene. 4. develop and evaluate transgenic crops expressing insect peptides which are orally active. The resulting insect tolerant crop varieties will contribute to the effort of developing an environmentally friendly and sustainable agriculture. This goal fits the CAP, promotes plant health, reduces farmers inputs and in general should be more acceptable to the consumer than some current practices.

Hypercapnia occurs because carbon dioxide produced as a metabolic end product accumulates in the recirculating water. It is well-established that hypercapnia is a physiological stressor because it causes impaired blood oxygen transport and tissue acid-base imbalances, and there is evidence that it could lead to oxidative stress in eel flesh, with consequent destruction of nutritionally valuable polyunsaturated fatty acids and production of free-radicals. Stress compromises growth and hence the economic viability of the fish farm, and oxidative stress influences the nutritional value of the product. The project will provide guidelines for the degree of hypercapnia that does not influence the performance and nutritional value of eels grown under intensive closed-cycle conditions. STATE OF PROGRESS  A significant amount of progress has been made during the second 12 months of the project. As described in the first annual report to the Commission, a decision was made to perform growth studies on small animals for shorter periods and then separately to adapt large animals to hypercapnia for physiological studies (the original work-plan foresaw maintaining small animals within the growth study until they reached a size suitable for physiological experimentation). Within the new approach, during the second 12 months, populations of small eels have been chronically exposed both to fixed levels (PWC02S: 0, 15±1, 30-+1 and 45±1 ~g) of hypercapnia and to fluctuating levels (PWC02S: 0, 15±10, 25±10 and 35±10 mmHg) of hypercapnia (Task 1), and their growth and mortality rates measured (Task 4). For reasons linked to internal restructuring at the La Casella facility where the eels are maintained, the growth study on small eels exposed to fluctuating levels of hypercapnia was initiated and completed immediately after the growth study on small eels exposed to fixed levels. Investigation of oxidative stress (Task 3) and feed acceptance (Task 4) was completed on the small eels chronically exposed to the fixed levels of hypercapnia. Tissues were collected from the small eels chronically exposed to fluctuating levels of hypercapnia and are presently being analysed to describe the presence of oxidative stress (Task 3). Following completion of the growth studies, large eels were chronically exposed to fixed levels of hypercapnia (Task 1) and the physiological effects of this described (Task 2, analysis of results only partial at present). Furthermore, an additional series of experiments on the physiological effects of acute hypercapnia exposure were performed (within Task 2).  ACHIEVEMENTS  Although the sequence of our Tasks has been modified (for the reasons stated above) and hence some of the deliverables have not been achieved according to the timetable described in the Technical Annex, very significant progress has been made. The studies on the effects of chronic exposure to fixed hypercapnia have been almost entirely completed, with the exception of one subtask (4c) and some data analysis within subtasks of Task 2. These latter measurements and analyses will be completed by spring 1999. The results to date indicate that eels can compensate for the physiological effects of mild hypercapnia (PWC02 = 15±1 mmHg) without any negative effects on growth. More severe hypercapnia (PwCO2's = 30+-1 or 45±1 mmHg) is tolerated but causes significant physiological stress and inhibition of growth. There appears to be little oxidative stress associated with chronic fixed levels of hypercapnia. The effects of exposure to fluctuating hypercapnia on growth have also been investigated, and revealed similar trends to those seen with fixed hypercapnia.  FUTURE ACTIONS  In the initial portion of the third year of the project, the participants will focus on completing the data collection and analyses within Tasks 2 and 4 for eels exposed to fixed hypercapnia. The remaining portion of the year, up to Month 36, will focus on completion of Task 2 (Physiological effects of hypercapnia), Task 3 (Oxidative stress associated with hypercapnia) and Task 4 (Effects of hypercapnia on performance) on large eels chronically exposed to four fluctuating CO2 levels. These will be completed and the results reported at Month 36. DESCRIPTION OF WORK  This project uses an automated computerised system to expose eels to a series of accurately controlled levels of chronic aquatic hypercapnia (Task 1). Experiments will then be performed to identify and quantify the physiological stress associated with this chronic exposure (Task 2), and to evaluate the oxidative stress in eel flesh through measures of lipid composition and various antioxidant parameters (Task 3). These analyses of physiological and oxidative stress will be correlated with specific indicators of performance such as growth and feed conversion efficiency (Task 4). These investigations will not only be performed on eels exposed to a constant degree of hypercapnia but also to diurnal cycles of fluctuating hypereapnia such as may result from feeding regimens. Close collaboration amongst Participants and effective integration of research activities is assured by the fact that almost all of the experimental work will be conducted at one site, ""La Casella"" Fluvial Hydrobiology Research Station (formerly Experimental Thermal Aquaculture Plant) run by ENEL-Ricerca in Northern Italy."

A number of enzymes from hyperthermophiles like Pyrococcus and Thermococcus, that are involved in DNA processing, are already on the market. The objective of this integrated project is aiming at the production of industrial enzymes (e.g. hydrolases and DNA polymerases) and other products (organic solutes and lipids) from selected extremophiles. Research work will be concentrating on few model organisms including hyperthermophiles (Pyrococcus, Thermococcus, Pyrodictium), extreme thermophiles (Thermotoga, Rhodothermus, Sulfolobus), psychrophiles ( Vibrio) and halophiles (Marinococcus). In order to overcome the limited production of enzymes and other organic compounds and in order to tailor these for specific applications the proposed project will be performed in an interdisciplinary manner involving (a) genetic engineering, (b) fermentation technology and (c) product engineering.  Various strategies will be used with the aim of optimization of growth of selected extremophiles. A special pilot plant bioreactor will be constructed which will allow a high mass transfer capacity between liquid and gaseous phase. Specific attention will be given to the development of expression systems for hyperthermophiles, thermoacidophiles and halophiles. The overexpression of novel products in extreme thermophiles and mesophiles will allow for further exploitation of the potential of these microbes. The analysis of structure-function relationships, the clarification of stability and specificity and catalysis mechanism will be needed to use enzymes from extremophiles in diagnostics, molecular biology and other industrial processes.

This overall objective will be achieved via a series of specific aims: (a) A physiological/biochemical and molecular genetical investigation of the regulation of activity, turnover and secretion of selected cold-active enzymes in psychrophilic bacteria and yeasts (as ""cell factories""), and the influence of thermal stresses on these processes, using existing collections of psychrophiles and from screening of new samplings from cold habitats. (b) The purification and crystallization of selected cold-active enzymes, and the cloning and over- expression of their genes, for the determination of the molecular basis of protein folding, flexibility and enzymic activity at low temperatures.  (c) The discovery and production by site-directed mutagenesis of cold-active enzymes with enhanced activity/stability at low temperatures, and their purification and testing in an industrial context, including the use of immobilised cells/enzymes for their exploitation in low-temperature biotechnology.  Compared with the enzymes from mesophilic and thermophilic (micro)organisms, knowledge about cold- active enzymes from psychrophiles is meagre, which is regrettable because recently it has been realised that there is a broad spectrum of potential biotechnological applications for cold-active enzymes and the psychrophilic microorganisms from which they are derived. The results of this project will be of both fundamental importance in understanding protein structure and applied significance in biotechnology. The major involvement of industrial partners in the proposed project will ensure that some of the potential avenues for exploitation will be explored, thus paving the way for further developments.  The project will involve two major fundamental and one applied experimental approaches: the fundamental approaches will investigate the  physiology/biochemistry of psychrophilic bacteria as ""cell factories"" and the molecular structure and dynamics of psychrophilic enzymes at low temperatures; the (third) applied experimental approach will explore the low-temperature stability of psychrophilic enzymes and explore their biotechnological potential. A few representative intracellular and extracellular enzymes have been selected so that in-depth study can be balanced with a reasonably broad perspective, on the bases that there is comparative data available on their structure, that sufficient background work has been performed (largely by the proposed participants themselves), and on their industrial relevance. The work will be organized in three work packages. The first, psychrophile physiology7 will consist of the isolation of new psychrophiles and the screening of these and existing collections for their efficient production of cold-active enzymes; investigation of the physiological activity and regulation of selected coldactive enzymes in psychrophilic bacteria and yeasts, and of recombinant enzymes in psychrophilic/mesophilic hosts. The second, enzyme structure, will involve the purification, sequencing and crystallization of selected psychrophilic enzymes, and the cloning/expression of their genes, for the determination of protein three-dimensional structure and molecular dynamics e.g.  by X-ray crystallography and NMR. In the third, enzyme biotechnology, enzymes having improved cold-active properties (enhanced activity/stability) will be selected from those obtained from new psychrophiles or produced by site-directed mutagenesis, in order to scale up their purification and production for testing (together with native enzymes) in an industrial context. Particular emphasis will be placed on enhancing enzyme stability without concomitant loss of activity, either by protein engineering or by the use of immobilised cells/enzymes."
100|grant.3722501|ENV4960320; 35437; LUCIFER|Land use change interactions with fire in Mediterranean Landscapes|Land use change interactions with fire in Mediterranean Landscapes|LUCIFER attempts to : a) Determine how the structure of the landscape has changed in the last 2-4 decades in fire-prone areas of all the Mediterranean countries of the EU, how fires themselves have contributed to such change, and what role have landscape changes played in promoting fire; b) Assess whether fires induce a further homogenization of the burned area, hence increasing fire risk; c) Evaluate the relationship between the patch heterogeneity created by the fire and the postfire flows of soil, water and nutrients from the burned area; d) Establish the role of burned area (a fire or patches differing in burning severity) on the postfire species dynamics, assess the basis for species change between burns, in particular for rare/endemic species, as wall as the potential colonization of burned areas by new species; e) based on past landscapes and fire incidence, develop models of landscape change and its significance for species dynamics in order to evaluate fire risk and other threats to the ecosystem in fire-prone areas resulting from landscape changes.     The Mediterranean landscapes have been considered as a model of fine-grain, most diverse natural and cultural landscape caused by the ancestral human use of the land. However, in the last decades, improved socio-economic conditions in EU-countries have altered land-uses, eventually conducing to a simplification of landscape features. Parallel to this, fire occurrence has increased manifold. Fires dominate now in many areas in an unprecented way, and may be altering the ecosystems in unknown ways. How the changes in the landscape have affected fire occurrence is little known. Similarly, little is also known about the impacts on key processes for soil and species maintenance produced by the changes in the landscape caused by fire. Understanding these interactions is needed to properly manage these areas. Additionally, this knowledge could also serve as a model for understanding potential impacts of land-use change in other fire-prone areas of the world.   To achieve the project objectives landscapes will be reconstructed in areas of all EU countries importantly affected by fire. Additionally, fires will be mapped and their occurrence evaluated in relation to conditions and landscape structure. Similarly, fire risk will be evaluated in the reconstructed landscapes by using fire behaviour models and other fire risk methods. Furthermore, the role of fire in modifying the landscape, either in prefire homogeneous areas or in areas differing in their recent land-use history, will be investigated also in areas across the southern EU countries by means of field monitoring of the vegetation complemented with remotely sensed data. The role of spatial patterns produced by fire, either by the burned area or by patches of fire severity will be objective of particular attention. Postfire flows of soil, water and nutrients will be related to such spatial changes in one pilot area. Additionally, how burned areas or patches within burned areas affect species (plant and some animal groups) maintenance in the system, with particular attention to rare and endemic species or to species with an invading potential, will also be investigated. Monitoring of species dynamics within burned patches or fires will be conducted also in areas of the East and West Mediterranean. Case studies for both, invaders and rare/endemic species, will be made. Finally, knowledge gained will be integrated through modelling to evaluate future landscapes and their potential effect on fire occurrence and for species maintenance in fire prone areas.

The aims are to improve understanding of the folding of secreted proteins and of the cellular factors which assist folding, and to exploit this to improve the efficiency of expression of correctly-folded high value recombinant proteins. The proposal addresses key issues highlighted in Cell Factories (Area 1) of the Work Programme in Biotechnology 1994-1998.  There will be significant opportunities for European industry to exploit outputs from the programme, as indicated by the participation of Zeneca and the strong expressions of support from other major companies.  The production of high value proteins in convenient host systems by use of recombinant DNA technology, is a major activity of the biotechnology industry. The markets for such proteins are in human/veterinary medicine, as pharmaceuticals, diagnostics or vaccines, and in the food or fine chemical industries as industrial enzymes. The great majority of the proteins of interest are extracellular proteins which, in the course of biosynthesis and secretion, undergo a complex series of steps involving targeting, folding, modification and assembly.  It is a considerable challenge to reproduce this series of events faithfully in a high-yield recombinant protein production system; many systems yield products which are misfolded (aggregated and lacking biological activity). In particular, secreted proteins are stabilised by intra- and inter-molecular disulphide bonds; formation of the correct disulphide bonds requires oxidising conditions and an appropriate set of enzymes to catalyse disulphide formation and isomerization.  The aim of the proposed programme is to extend knowledge of these enzymes in bacteria and eukaryotic cells and to apply them to manipulate host cell expression systems so that high levels of desired recombinant proteins can be combined with efficient correct folding.  The programme will fall into 3 sections: A) studies on the pathways of folding of challenging disulphide-bonded model proteins, based on recent advances in mass spectrometry, B) studies on the catalysts of protein disulphide bond formation in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, and C) studies in-vivo on cell and medium engineering to optimise expression of proteins. Information will flow from A to B to C, permitting exploitation in vívo of understanding of the properties of the catalysts in vi tro .  The consortium comprises world-leading laboratories in the study of the key enzymes, in the molecular analysis of protein folding pathways and in industrial-scale protein folding. Each partner in the programme will interact with several others and the whole programme will operate as a network. The programme is totally dependent on this trans-national collaboration and could not be conducted without support at this level; the collaborators bring different skills, facilities and background experience to the programme and form a very strong European team.

To fill the gap between thermophilic LAB and other industrially important microorganisms, a coordinate effort of 9 European laboratories from 6 Countries, with complementary skills and interests, will be performed. This consortium, for its size and distribution of roles, represents an important opportunity for EU to take the world leadership in this growing field. The ambition of the project is to perform a broad study of thermophilic LAB by means of all the tools made available by recent microbiological research. The whole topic will be divided into the following four packages and will be basically devoted to food-grade strains. Mutual flow of data among packages will be constant.  Package I. Metabolic engineering. The work will be aimed at understanding and improving the following important metabolic traits: lactose/galactose metabolism, polysaccharide secretion and properties, proteolysis, lactic acid fermentation, and amino acid biosynthesis and transport.  Packaqe II. Environmental and stress response. This part of the work will be aimed at gaining a better knowledge and an improvement of the adaptive responses of thermophilic LAB to changes such as pH, temperature, nutrient and salt concentration, which are common in food fermentations.  Package III. Expression and secretion systems. Such systems, which have proven to be essential strain improvement tools for mesophilic strains, will be developed and applied to thermophilic LAB: to this purpose various inducible promoters and secretion vectors encoding fusion proteins will be isolated. Package IV. Genetic transfer. A more advanced understanding and a facilitated use of these tools (mainly conjugation and transduction in various species and genomic integration in L. helveticus) will be pursued in order to ease strain construction.  Within completion of the project we expect to bring into the literature a number o scientific papers that will describe in detail relevant metabolic traits and produce cloning vectors, strains secreting fused proteins and information about the mechanisms of gene expression.  Our work is also expected to allow us to optimize strain usage and to select new starter strains for better performance in cheese and yoghurt making. Pilot and industrial scale fermentation technology to test our strains will be available from our industrial partners. Biotechnological innovations deriving from this project will be made available to external users in the spirit of EU guidelines.

The goal of the proposed research is to study how bribes are determined in equilibrium keeping into account that no enforceable contracts can be used in the bargaining process. Once reneging of a previous offer is allowed, the ""seller"" (public official) might have incentives to renege on previous offer that were accepted by the ""buyer"" (private agent) as his acceptance might signal his willingness to pay for a higher bribe.  The result expected is that sequential bargaining does not lead to information transmission and to an approximately efficient solution so that the basic intuition of the Coase Conjecture fails in this setting. Realistic situations will be studied, with the objective to provide normative suggestions to curb corruption and to minimize its economic consequences."

This replication phase could last indicatively 8 to 10 years, for the construction of ca. 50 new M/Bs. The technology and vessels type developed could be directly transferred to application in other water cities, such as Amsterdam, Lisbon, etc., but the benefits go beyond the urban water transports, since the erosion of banks and bottom of rivers and canals and the disturbance and damage to vessels moored alongside is of increasing concern in countries crossed by trafficated waterways, such as Holland and Germany.   The main innovative issues addressed by LIUTO are:  - Study of hull hydrodynamics, with validation of numerical models, based on accurate wave far field measurement in addition to resistance and near field criteria;  - Optimisation of vessel manoeuvrability by numerical and experimental analysis of hull-propeller performance and interference;  - Study and development of GRP composite materials suited for commercial passenger service, satisfying safety, durability, aestethical and life-cycle cost requirements;  - Hull structure and propulsion design optimised to meet the THERMIE-DEMO hybrid energy system;  - Study and development of innovative azimutal thrust systems, comparing experimentally jet systems with more traditional screw propellers; - Study and development of propulsion system control, to optimise motor power delivery as function of the actual working condition of the propeller (e.g. cavitation and stalling prevention control).   The six partners proposing LIUTO cover the full spectrum of roles and expertise needed to assure its technical success and the economic exploitation of results.

100|grant.3727627|BMH4960814; 32532|Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Signalling in Human cancer|Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Signalling in Human cancer|Signalling cascades triggered by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are frequently activated in human cancer. To comprehend the role of RTKs in tumours and devise strategies to intercede with their function, detailed understanding of their mechanisms of action including ligand regulation and activation of cytoplasmic signal transducers, is required.   This proposal focuses on the ErbB and RET subfamilies of RTKs based upon their established involvement in prevalent types of human cancer. Members of the ErbB RTK family including EGFR, ErbB2 and ErbB3, are involved in human tumours by overexertion and constitutive receptor activation. While autocrine stimulation of the EGFR in tumours has been established, the role of natural ligands for the related ErbB receptors remains elusive. RET which encodes a RTK lacking a known ligand, is activated by structural abnormalities as a dominant transforming gene in various tumour types.   To characterise ligand-receptor interactions relevant to malignancy, we will attempt to identify and isolate novel ligands regulating the activity of ErbB2, ErbB3 and RET. Among known ligands, the role of HRG on ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4 activity will be determined in model systems.   Furthermore, the function of membrane-anchored forms of TGF and HRG will be analysed, including possible intrinsic signalling properties associated with their cytoplasmic domains. Known ligand-receptor interactions will be exploited to specifically target tumour cells overexpressing ErbB family receptors in vitro and in vivo using cytotoxic T lymphocytes with recombinantly engineered T cell receptor components.   Mechanisms of receptor heterodimerisation including ligand-independent activation will be determined for ErbB2 and ErbB3 synergy, whereas the activating potential of novel mutations in the ErbB2 juxtamembrane region will be evaluated for ErbB2 signalling properties.   Pathophysiologically relevant model systems will be established to measure ErbB and RET receptor function. Reversion of neoplastic phenotypes induced by MEN2A, MEN2B and mutated ErbB2, will be attempted by use of mutation-specific antisense oligonucleotides. In the case of activated RET alleles, this approach will be complemented by investigating the potential of certain Hirschsprung alleles to function as dominant-negatives. At the substrate level, research is focused on targets of mitogenic control relevant for human cancer. Thus, substrates in ErbB receptors and RET pathways segregating with increased transforming potential are of particular interest including those shared between RET and ErbB2 as well as substrates specifically associated with signal transduction by RET-MEN2B, ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimers and point-mutated ErbB2. Moreover, among a battery of tyrosine kinase substrates analysed, shc and eps8 are frequently tyrosine phosphorylated in human tumours projecting their role as universal targets for tyrosine kinases activated in human tumours.   To expand the mechanistic understanding of eps8 and shc phosphorylation in tumours, functional interactions between both substrates will be investigated, and target proteins in the signalling cascade will be characterised. The physiologic role of eps8 will be investigated by gene targeting in mice. To facilitate rapid identification of tumours with activated tyrosine kinases that would be amenable for therapeutic approaches involving tyrosine kinase inhibitors, screening tests based upon shc and eps8 phosphorylation will be developed. Furthermore, this approach will provide the basis for the identification of novel tyrosine kinases selected on the basis of their involvement in human neoplasia.

Heat is also used to improved the sensory properties of food, particularly flavour and colour. One of the important transformations that happens during heating of food, is the reaction between reducing sugars (monosaccharides or disaccharides) and proteins and/or amino acids. This reaction is a type of non-enzymic browning and is often referred to as the Maillard Reaction, after the researcher who first discovered it. The overall objective of the proposed research is to understand the factors and inter-relationships between factors that affect flavour, colour and nutritional quality and toxicological safety of all the foods that undergo the Maillard Reaction during thermal processing and to obtain better control of the Maillard Reaction via process optimisation. Control of the reaction may be interpreted in two ways. First, it can mean preventing the reaction, as far as possible, by inhibiting it or by minimising it. Second, control may involve optimising the reaction to achieve optimum flavour and colour development coupled with reduced levels of toxic compounds and maximised nutritional value. The ability to control the reaction simultaneously, with regard to flavour, colour, nutrition and toxicology, represents a challenge for the food technologist.  Means of achieving better control requires a deeper understanding of the processes concerned, and will result in improved quality and safety of food for the ultimate benefit of the consumer.  Since a much better understanding on the Maillard Reaction is required in order to improve the flavour, colour, nutritional and toxicological properties of heated foods, the objectives of the proposal are : - to obtain a deeper understanding of the complex processes known as the  Maillard Reaction; - to gain a better appreciation of how the controlling factors influence the  reaction. This information will greatly aid the production of foods with improved  safety and sensory quality; - to obtain an improved kinetic understanding of the processes involved; - to apply the data obtained to important foods such as milk, milk products, meat   products, fish and fish products, and process flavourings.  The problem of the lack of satisfactory control of the Maillard Reaction will be approached from different angles. All factors which can influence the reaction between protein and/or amino acids and sugars in foods are important and each participant will deal with a different aspect.

During this programme we developed new anti-ras oligonucleotides. In the present programme we will carry out the necessary experiments to bring this new potential anti-cancer treatment to the clinic.  We have shown that antisense oligonucleotides directed to a point mutation in codon 12 of the Ha-ras mRNA selectively inhibited the proliferation of cells expressing the mutated Ha-ras gene. Tumour growth of these cells in nude mice was markedly inhibited after subcutaneous injection of antisense dodecamer absorbed to nanoparticles.   The predominant nuclease activity which degrades oligonucleotides intracellularly and extracellularly are 3'-exonucleases. By attaching short alkyl chains connected to the 3'-position of antisense dodecamer, we have enhanced stability of the dodecamer towards nucleases and lowered tumour growth inhibition dose by 100-fold.   The discovery of these highly active and selective oligonucleotide analogues prompts us to propose pharmaceutical and medical applications.   Activated mutated Ha-ras has been found in several cancers including bladder carcinomas. Oligonucleotides could be instilled intravesically, as an adjuvant therapy, in order to prevent progression or relapse after endoscopie resection. Therapeutic applications of antisense oligonucleotides to cancer treatment require information concerning the in vivo behaviour of olignonucleotides. Therefore, this proposal will focus on the in vivo evaluation of Ha-ras targeted 3'-end modified antisense oligonucleotides.   The proposal contains three main lines of investigation :   1. In vitro and in vivo evaluation of the efficacy of antisense oligonucleotides : Evaluation of original modifications which could improve the stability and the uptake of oligonucleotides. 2. Pharmacological studies : organ distribution, clearance kinetics and toxicity of modified dodeacamers will be studied in mammalians. 3. Collection of clinical samples and characterisation : the aim is to collect bladder carcinomas samples exhibiting ras mutation in order to establish primary culture and derived cell lines. At the same time antisense oligonucleotide activity will be evaluated and clinical trials will be started in the most optimal conditions.

Establishing a link between the morphological type and the molecular biological changes with radiation exposure closer to Chernobyl will then allow assessment of the relevance of possible small increases in countries exposed to lower levels of fallout, a clearer link between exposure and risk, and the continuation of that risk. It will also allow an assessment of the role of shortlived isotopes, as these become progressively less important as compared to 131I in the more distant areas which were reached by fallout at a later time than the areas close to Chernobyl. It is therefore expected that this work will enable us to answer in whole or in part the following questions:  (1) Does the increase in thyroid cancer observed in children between 4 and 8 ye after exposure to fallout from the Chernobyl accident continue, and does it inv a particular cohort giving tumours in older patients with the passage of time?  (2) Is the association of a particular pattern of morphology with exposure to fallout confirmed, and does this association hold for older patients?  (3) Is there a specific pattern of growth factor or oncogene involvement in presumed radiation induced thyroid carcinomas, and does this alter with increas time?  (4) Is there any evidence that the number and relative frequency of carcinomas the morphology of radiation induced tumour is influenced by the relative exposure to short and long lived isotopes of iodide?  We intend to use a variety of techniques to address these questions, morphologi analysis, growth factor and oncogene localisation on formalin fixed paraffin embbeded sections from pathological material obtained from centres in the CIS, well as conventional molecular biological techniques to define the presence of and the type of mutation or translocation in oncogenes known or suspected to be involved in human thyroid carcinogenesis. We will compare these results with tu from age and sex matched controls from non irradiated populations and with thyr tumours induced by radiation in transgenic mice which show thyroid specific oncogene expression.

Its overall objective is to develop and to implement a Probability based Integrated Design Approach (PIDA) for vertical breakwaters and further classes of monolithic structures where wave effects dominate design considerations.  To achieve this goal, the results gained in MAST I, in further national research projects and in the ongoing MCS-Project, as well as the new knowledge to be generated in this project will be linked together to develop and implement probabilistic design tools which should replace the conventional deterministic design methods and form the scientific and technical basis for any future authoritative design guidelines.  The major part of the proposed work consists, however, in advancing the knowledge and preparing an integrated probabilistic framework. The following tasks are required for this purpose:  Task 1: Hydrodynamic aspects. This task will provide the hydrodynamic inputs (wave loadings, including associated uncertainties and statistical distributions) required to implement the prospective probabilistic tools in Tas 3D-hydraulic model tests will form the major part of this task, supplemented by further physical and numerical modelling.  Task 2: Foundation aspects. Beside the development of new knowledge related to failure mechanisms and dynamic soil properties, information will be generated on probability, partial safety factors and uncertainties for soil parameters and models, making them readily applicable for the implementation of probabilistic tools in Task 4. Analysis, numerical modelling and laboratory tests will build the major means for the investigations, supplemented by centrifuge modelling and prototype measurements.  Task 3: Structural aspects. This task will provide the methods to assess the structural strength of breakwater walls under pulsating and extreme impact loading, as well as their durability. Uncertainties in the loading and resistance parameters will be accounted for as needed in Task 4. Finite element analysis will principally be used for the investigations.  Task 4: Probabilistic tools. This task will develop in a first preparatory phase a probabilistic framework by linking together all above aspects and morphological aspects from results of ongoing MCS-Project and further national projects, by describing the failure modes, by establishing the fault trees, by evaluating the associated uncertainties and developing a reliability design philosophy. In a second phase, the probabilistic design tools will be developed. Based on reliability calculations at Level II and III, on the analysis of case studies and involvement of practitioners, a method to assess the overall reliability of vertical breakwaters will be developed and applied to a set of selected representative structures.

Understanding the genetic etiology of non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus critical for envisioning effective strategies to prevent and to treat, ultimately to cure this common disease. The main objective of the present proposal is the building and managing of a European research network which will focus on the identification of the genetic alterations in the mechanism of insulin action resulting in the susceptibility to NIDDM. The network has four measurable aims:   1. Facilitate the identification of NIDDM genes by establishing a European database and cell-line bank containing information (family history, medical history, clinical, and laboratory data) and specimens, (lymphoblastoid cell lines, skin fibroblasts and sera) on families with well-documented NIDDM. This material will be available to all qualified European researchers in the field of insulin action and NIDDM etiology upon accomplishment of this task.   2. Disseminate know-how information and specialized technologies which are presently available only in a few European laboratories working in the field of insulin action.   3. Training young European researchers in the field of molecular biology of NIDDM by favouring the mobility between the participating laboratories.   4. Coordinate the research activities in the participating laboratories as a prerequisite to the possible launching of share cost projects at a later stage.  This work will involve the systematic scanning for alterations in potential candidate genes coding for elements in the signalling cascade used by insulin (these include SHC, MAP kinase, PI-3-kinase, Glut1, rab4, Glycogen Synthase kinase, Protein Phosphatase 1, ane IGF-I Binding Proteins). In order to detect both quantitative alterations in the expression of these genes and mutations, solution hybridization/RNase protection, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and single stranded conformational polymorphism will be adopted as screening procedures. Bioptical specimens of muscle and fat tissue will be used as starting material.

The project deals with a broad solar cell production cycle from crystallisation up to an encapsulated solar cell. The detailed objectives are as follows: - screening the current and future environmental regulations, - decrease amount of wet chemicals used in cell fabrication, - development of Czochralski monocrystalline silicon material with reduced oxygen content,  - determination of cost efficient wafer thickness and size, - achievement of 19% efficient large area (10x10cm2) encapsulated Czochralski monocrystalline silicon solar cells.   Technical Approach   The project is divided into 6 tasks, each with a task leader who organises experiments of limited duration, and takes care of their execution, complying with the time schedule and milestones.  1 Crystallisation and wafering: development of Cz-Si material with a low oxygen content, large and thin substrates with different bulk resistivities (Bayer).  2 Environmental issues, cleaning and etching: study the environmental restrictions and stimulate the development of solar cell processes with an unavoidable minimum of hazardous processing materials (Siemens Solar). 3 Design and optimisation of solar cell processes: development of a commercial process fulfilling requirements of   efficiency and low cost (IMEC).  4 Measurements and modelling: create a reliable basis for all possible characterisations and modelling of substrate   materials and solar cells developed during the project   (Univ. Napoli).  5 Cell-module interaction: studying the different encapsulating materials, accelerated stability tests and cell-module interaction (Soltech).  6 Implementation in a production line: implementation of developed processes in the BP Solar, Siemens Solar and Bayer production pilot lines, assessment of efficiency and cost (BP Solar).   Expected Achievements and Exploitation   The optimisation of materials and processing steps should result in a solar cell process compatible with mass production. An efficiency of 19% on large area (10x10cm2) Czochralski monocrystalline silicon should be achieved as well as a significant reduction of the hazardous materials both in the processing and waste materials. The project will result in a large reduction in the cost/Wp since it aims at significant increase of solar cells efficiency while involving only low cost, industrial type processing techniques and the solar cell processing itself only takes a relatively small fraction of the overall module cost. The optimised process will be implemented in the production lines of the industrial partners.
100|grant.3735731|JOR3950021; 37067|Fixed bed gasification of agricultural residues|Fixed bed gasification of agricultural residues|Objectives   The development of advanced gasification technologies is especially important for Mediterranean countries, where no network of gasifiers exists to exploit the energy potentially available through the large quantities of agricultural residues produced. On the other hand, the infrastructure of the countries does not allow the installation of large plants because of the difficulties of feedstock collection and transportation. Thus, this project is concerned with atmospheric pressure gasification of straw and other agricultural residues, typical of Mediterranean areas, for decentralized heat and power production.   The different aspects of the problem will be taken into account through the different stages of the process:  - availability, pre-treatment, transportation and storage of feedstocks  - evaluation of their physico-chemical properties and thermo-chemical behavior,  - conversion, operation of a commercial plant and combustion tests on the producer gas.   Technical approach   The development of the work program is based on both experimental and theoretical investigations. Intra-particle gasification characteristics (chemical kinetics) of different feedstocks will be evaluated through a fast radiant heating system, with controlled sample temperature (Univ. Napoli) and a free-fall reactor (KTH, Stockholm). Extra-particle (rate) gasification characteristics will be investigated by means of updraft (Ansaldo Volund R&D, Univ. Napoli), downdraft (Univ. Zaragoza) and fluid-bed (KTH, Stockholm) reactors on both a laboratory and a pilot plant scale. Effects of feedstock pretreatments (NTUA, Athens) on the gas quality will be studied and the feasibility will be assessed of using the producer gas for an internal combustion engine, as a way of generating electricity. The development of detailed transport models, including all main chemical and physical processes of gasification to predict process dynamics and to optimize reactor design and operation, is an important part of the project (Univ. Napoli).   Expected Achievements and Exploitation   The main outputs of the project are:  - Quantification of the potential use of agricultural residues for decentralized heat and power production in some areas of Southern and Northern Europe,  - Definition of the optimal pre-treatments for transportation, storage and conversion,  - Determination of the intra-particle and rate gasification characteristics of agricultural residues (with special emphasis on fixed-bed gasification),  - Optimization of the updraft and downdraft gasification technologies,  - Improvement in the understanding of the fundamentals of biomass thermo-chemical conversion.

A programme of field measurements and process investigations will be carried out at field  stations in Almeria (Spain), Spata (Greece) and Sardinia (Italy), to establish long term trends in  desertification, investigate key processes of desertification and soil erosion and contribute  towards establishing a European and International data and information base. In Spain additional  measurements will be made i) to assess the response of the vegetation, runoff and sediment yield  to climate variability; ii) to model the influence of the spatial dynamics of patchy vegetation on  runoff and sediment and iii) maintain and update  the Rambla Honda field site at the patch and hillslope scale. In Sardinia data on climate, surface  runoff, sediment yield, vegetation and soil moisture in experimental plots with different land use  conditions will be measured. In Greece data will be collected to establish relations between soil  erosion and loss in plant productivity of rain-fed cereals and to quantifying the effect of land  abandonment.  In Spain, specific studies are being undertaken of: the adaption of natural vegetation under stress  and environmental change; of soil faunal activity; soil moisture vegetation relations under stress;  the influence of plant roots on infiltration; and the management of stony soils. In Sardinia, land  degradation description indicators and grazing impacts are being studied.  Modelling activities, associated with the MEDRUSH land degradation model and its application  in the target areas are being developed, expanded and consolidated. This covers  ecological, land degradation and large basin and landslide modelling. For the ecological  modelling a tree model, a model which allows competition between life forms, a generic fire  model and a grazing model for inclusion in the vegetation model will be developed. The land  degradation modelling will cover the validation of the MEDRUSH model for the Agri and other  target areas; the development of a grazing component, the integration of socio-economic models with MEDRUSH and the development of sub-MEDRUSH model for  areas of 100 km2. The large basin modelling consist of an implementation of MEDRUSH in the  Agri and Guadalentin basins and the identification and use of a database to validate the SHETRAN landslide component.  The MEDRUSH model, produced during Medalus II is being developed and applied as a  management tool in the target areas of the Guadalentin (Spain), Agri (Italy) and Gerje (Hungary)  rivers. The Agri modelling involves scaling and spatial variability analyses of water transport  processes, model sensitivity analysis and relevant parameter definition; model validation and  testing; comparison of model results from other target areas and evaluation of model performance and output reliability.  In the Judean desert (Israel) and in Canada, international partners are undertaking research, that  is integrated into the Medalus programme, under conditions that are more extreme than  in Europe.

Especially in manufacturing industries, in tool machines, aircraft, cars and automation which were the strengths of European industry we are losing our position in the -markets with respect to companies from Japan and Asia. A new emerging area of great potential application for new and advanced actuators is the area of smart (or intelligent) structures, material and systems. Quite obviously, the broad scope of the potential applications that emerges from this new technologies cannot be addressed by only few actuators devices and different types have been proposed, like micro-actuators, piezoelectric, electro/magneto-rheological, electromagnetic, shape memory material and magnetostrictive.  Rare earth-iron magnetostricitve alloy are featured by ""giant"" strains when excited by a magnetic field. Therefore the target of this proposal is to address this particular or unique characteristic of the magnetostrictive material to accomplish the need in two specific and very important fields of application in which the demand of actuators with unusual performances in term of forces and frequency range is very strong. These field of application are:  - Detection and identification of damaged structures;  - Active control of vibration.   In the field of active vibration control and related field of active vibration isolation, very often strong limitation are reported due to narrow frequency bandwidths, complicated design or an inability to support static weight, of the conventional actuators. Vibration control in heavy duty application and high dynamics is missing. Same limitations have been reported or foreseen for the emerging and very promising field of damage detection and identification of the structures although this research area holds very strong importance for health monitoring of structures. Hence the whole of proposal topics covers the following areas: reliability and quality of materials and products, safety and reliability of production systems, technologies for vehicle safety, technologies for aircraft safety. The work-plan is finalised to design and construct some actuators prototypes. One type of actuator is not sufficient for several engineering applications because it is not easy to produce actuators with equal capability in a wide frequency and force range. Therefore the programme is addressed to design and achieve 4 light actuators for the applications in which low forces are requested and 2 heavy actuators for the applications which need high forces. In order to meet the project technical objectives the required principal tasks are outlined as follows:  - Requirement Definition for Magnetostrictive Actuators  - Material Choice  - Design and Numerical Simulation  - Construction of Light Actuator Prototypes  - Construction of Heavy Actuator Prototypes  - Signal Processing and Control  - Utilisation of Magnetostrictive Actuators and Sensors in Engineering Problems.   Hence organisation of work-packages is addressed to define the design guidelines and to achieve prototypes of enhanced magnetostrictive actuators for the engineering application above mentioned."

The project is based on the great originality of substances present in marine organisms, mainly invertebrates. Moreover, a considerable number of species have not yet been studied for their pharmacologic aspects.  The success of this project depends mainly on the capacity of the participating teams to carry it out effectively (Cf. the presentation letter attached to the application) and the scientific options taken: 1. Two branches have been retained for study: sponges and tunicates (ascidians). Sponges have provided the largest number of original marine molecules, including several of pharmacologic interest. The ascidians, composed of fewer species, were chosen because of the exceptional frequency of nitrogenous metabolites which often possess high activity. Moreover, both of these branches consist of filtering organisms, and it has often been suggested that several pharmacologically important metabolites come from their associated microorganisms. This is a considerable advantage in the perspective of biotechnological production of interesting molecules. We have selected a variety of sampling areas: two widely separated tropical zones (the Vanuatu and the west coast of Madagascar), for which we have noted an important, original biological potential; a warm temperate zone (the Mediterranean), where sponge collection at Ustica Island has provided several interesting leads which will be followed up in the project; and a cold temperate zone (the Atlantic coast of France) which is still unexplored with respect to potentially antiviral and immunomodulatory substances.  2. The marine environment appears to be especially rich in antitumoral molecules (several marine substances are now at the clinical trial stage) and to a lesser extent in antiviral molecules, though this field has been less studied. The immunomodulatory field is relatively unexplored and thus propitious for discoveries.  3. Particular emphasis has been given to the quality of pharmacologic screening, which will be performed on collected species in order to ensure that chemical studies (extraction, purification, structural identification, synthesis or structural modulation) are not undertaken without a maximal chance of success.  For example, the proposed approach for antitumoral screening should allow us, in particular, to avoid those substances often present in marine organisms which are potentially too toxic.  4. The molecules, once identified, will be evaluated by in-depth pharmacologic studies in order to search for activities. In particular, animal experimentation will be untertaken, such as the use of xenografted human tumors for antitumoral studies. The most promising substances will be proposed to European industry.  Rhone-Poulenc Rorer (Paris) have agreed to provide expert evaluation of the antitumoral and antiviral substances and ensure their eventual development. Sandoz (Wien) has been contracted for immunomodulatory substances and we are waiting for a definitive reply.
100|grant.3723600|AC110; 30548; NICE|National host interconnection experiments|National host interconnection experiments|"The key issue addressed by NICE is how to mount distributed broadband applications on an ATM infrastructure, quickly and easily. NICE is concentrating on distributed teleconferencing applications, together with fast asynchronous services. This is because there is a real need to support teleconferences and distributed meetings associated with ACTS and other EU R&D activities. The National Hosts are the prime vehicle for providing these experimental services. NICE is therefore integrating systems so as to enable groups of National Hosts to provide common, international broadband teleconferencing and fast asynchronous services based on ATM. NICE is also using the experience gained to provide advice and guidance to ACTS projects seeking to use these applications between the National Hosts or to create their own applications. NICE will later inform the telecommunications community about techniques and conventions which are useful for test and operation of this class of applications over ATM. The membership and activities of NICE have been extended in 1996 to Central & E. Europe (CEE) and the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union (NIS). Canadian researchers are also collaborating in NICE trials. The aim is to spread knowledge, skills and contacts in the field of broadband communications and to ensure that experimental services can be shared with researchers outside of Europe. Support from NICE will enable the National Hosts to provide common broadband applications for the R&D community on an international basis.  NICE spans Europe and beyond - from Ottawa to Novosibirsk Expected Impact The dissemination of results to the international telecommunications community and to standardisation bodies will contribute to the creation of new international standards in the area of broadband applications and services. The extension of NICE to E. Europe will help to create vital centres of expertise and new National Host organisations. This will make it easier for these countries to build broadband services for R&D in collaboration with organisations in Western Europe.  Main contributions to the programme objectives: Main deliverables Organisation of distributed Summer schools and various seminars on broadband communications technology: including over 10 locations distributed over Western and Eastern Europe and the United States/Canada. Contribution to the programme Creating awareness for the possibilities of broadband among a wide audience of students and professionals in telecommunications. Giving feedback to the ACTS community on the practical realisation of broadband applications : from technical issues up to organisational/operational issues. Technical Approach NICE integrates systems consisting of broadband network configurations and local computers and applications software. NICE seeks to extend the functionality of the applications and to enable them to be set up and run on a variety of infrastructures, including satellite links. Systems are subjected to large scale trials with live users, so as to ensure their performance and acceptability. These international trials are on a scale that no one participant or country could mount by itself. In addition to the technical part of these trials, NICE has provided the organisation and content of the distributed Summer School in 1996 and will do the same for a distributed event in E. Europe in 1997. These events include lectures, discussions, tutorials and demonstrations. When trials are completed NICE publishes the results as ""validated configurations."" These are defined sets of equipment and telecommunications services together with tools and procedures to install and test them. NICE is promoting its validated configurations for use by the National Hosts and will give consultancy and support to those National Hosts which decide to adopt these and participate in international services. The international connections between the National Hosts will be provided either via terrestrial links or via satellite.  In E. Europe and the former Soviet Union NICE will adapt its technology to fit the available infrastructure. It will also provide guidance to organisations seeking to set up National Hosts. NICE is accumulating a fund of knowledge in the integration and operation of teleconferencing applications over ATM and is passing on this knowledge to other users. We are using the InfoWin project to publish information and are supplementing this with our own newsletter and Web site for more detailed information. To do its work NICE has three technical workpackages, dealing with systems integration, ATM-over-satellite and operations support for trials and user projects. These are supplemented by two workpackages for external liaison and project management. Summary of Trial NICE has completed a first round of trials in 1996, and has published the first set of validated configurations for large-scale teleconferences, for the extension of these teleconferences through the MBONE and for high-speed document collection and distribution. The 1996 trials included the 4th Advanced Broadband Communications Summer School. This was a 4-day conference covering 22 sites plus an additional distribution to MBONE sites, resulting in an audience of around 1000 people. NICE has also run a distributed meeting for the G7's GIBN project. This involved members of a working party at four different sites in Europe and N. America co-operating to edit a joint report. Ten new partners from Eastern Europe and the former USSR joined the project in September 1996 and are now fully integrated in its work. In January 1997 NICE ran its first internal trial linking Russian and Western partners in a workshop."

Growth Hormone and related substances, particularly in relation to sport.  To develop a validation methodology sufficiently robust to withstand legal challenge and allow prosecution and conviction of those illegally using Growth Hormone.  To develop the ethical and legal framework to control and deal effectively with growth hormone abuse  Growth hormone is a naturally occurring hormone secreted into the bloodstream by the pituitary gland. Its effects include an anabolic action, to increase lean body mass and reduce fat mass. These properties have led to its abuse by athletes body builders and even schoolchildren who inject biosynthetic growth hormone in order to try to enhance their physical appearance and performance. This abuse seems likely to increase, not only because biosynthetic growth hormone will become more easily available and less expensive, but also because, in contrast to synthetic anabolic steroids, its use cannot be detected by current dope testing. Growth-hormone abuse leads to unfair competition and puts the recipients at risk of adverse effects. More worryingly, some athletes may be using illicit growth hormone derived from human pituitary tissue rather than by biosynthetic means leading to risk of infection with the agent responsible for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a fatal condition affecting the central nervous system. This project is designed to develop a reliable methodology for the detection of the misuse of exogenous growth hormone. It involves collaboration between, i) 4 clinical academic centres (London, Göteborg, Aarhus and Naples) who are all leading experts in peptide hormone research and in particular the use of growth hormone in various disease states, ii) the Industrial Partners (Pharmacia and Novo Nordisk) who are 2 of the world's largest producers of growth hormone and iii) The International Olympic Committee which is the focus of the International Sports Authorities and through it's Sub-Commission ""Doping and Biochemistry in Sport"", creates, accredits and maintains an international network of laboratories which provide the main thrust for the detection of doping in sport. These partners, along with various state of the art subcontractors will combine and co-ordinate their considerable expertise to carry out a series of detailed physiological and pharmacological studies in athletes in order to devise a means of reliably detecting exogenous growth hormone administration and then to implement this testing both in and out of competition to prevent this form of abuse. The methodology will be commercialised by the pharmaceutical partners and will be introduced as routine methodology in the network of IOC laboratories. This work will also contribute to the closer collaboration between the clinical partners strengthening their position as leaders in peptide hormone research and will add considerably to the state of knowledge surrounding the physiology of growth hormone."

Two diverse training domains have been selected (music industry and networking) for the requirements they provide regarding bandwidth, synchronisation and quality of service. The main objectives are to demonstrate that: - A broadband digital network based upon an integrated ATM, CATV and ISDN is capable of supporting a comprehensive computer based interactive vocational training environment; - The provision of an integrated environment from bearer to the desktop can be supplied on a heterogeneous and distributed infrastructure for use by non computer-literate users. The project contributes to the Information Society in Europe by demonstrating an application of potential practical value to large numbers of individuals and businesses throughout the region, but underpinned by a model of the ongoing cost implications of deployment derived from the tariff structure developed in the project. The project will also increase understanding of the feasibility of using emerging broadband technologies as a medium for updating skills in the European workforce. Expected Impact  Whilst RENAISSANCE will concentrate on the development and provision of communications services, the application domains have been selected to generate real uptake and to offer societal benefits in contributing to technologies for economic regeneration. The Networking and Music Industry training domains have been selected because they have an audience of early adopters with some experience of computer aided applications. Results of the project are being promoted both within the ACTS Programme and to the wider community by publications, conference presentations and through workshops hosted by the project.  Main contributions to the programme objectives: Main deliverables The project produced a demonstrator for online learning which was run over interworking ATM, CATV and Ethernet networks. Contribution to the programme The project demonstrated the feasibility of running sophisticated, distributed online learning services over heterogeneous networks using an IP fabric to integrate the underlying networks.  Technical Approach  The RENAISSANCE System is based upon an integration of broadband ATM and CATV network technologies and NISDN within a comprehensive layered service architecture, with ATM (via JAMES) providing the underlying backbone interconnection infrastructure for pan-European connectivity. This will demonstrate the viability for a service delivery business model which is independent of bearers and components and also capable of interoperability across technology boundaries. Key technical areas which the project is exploring are: - Development of a three layer model encompassing network, information and user services to construct a fully integrated, distributed solution for the provision of distance vocational training; - Network Services: The network infrastructure itself based upon the use of IP across the ISDN, CATV and ATM bearers for both LAN based and remote access users; - Information Services: The basic application services using the IP network (e.g. WWW, X.400/X.500, ISO SR); - User Services: The integrated desktop which brings together the information services, management environment and the vocational training environment; - A thorough impact analysis and evaluation of the suitability of emerging technologies for this application domain; - The development of a tariffing model from bearer to user which demonstrates the costs incurred at each layer of the system; - The development of end-to-end performance models and the validation of these with the established trial infrastructure itself; - The broadband digital data communications capabilities of the CATV cable network infrastructures. This contribution will include work with the IEEE 802.14 standards committee and their collaborations with DAVIC and the ATM Forum; - Refinement of the API between the user/information service toolset and the course-ware. This involves participation in the BESA working group defining the Open Integrated Learning System standard (OILS). Summary of Trial  The RENAISSANCE trial will establish a vocational training infrastructure which will be used to supply training on ""Operating and Managing a Recording Studio"" and ""Organising a European Concert Tour"", for the music industry, and ""Local Area Network Internetworking & Interoperability"" and ""Business Information Technology"", for the networking industry. This Trial will run for a period of eight months. Three server sites will be established across Europe (Dublin, Sheffield and Sligo) to support the five specialised vocational training SMEs and educational institution delivery sites (Dublin, Naples, Newark, Samos and Sheffield). The National Hosts supporting this infrastructure are: Northwest Labs with their interconnected CATV, ATM and NISDN networks; Yorkshire Cable with their NISDN and CATV networks; ATM provision is being negotiated with BT, Telecom Eireann and Telecom Italia under the JAMES Project. The trials will support the vocation training Learning Environment, X.400/X.500, WWW, Mbone, ISO SR and a variety of file transport services. Key Issues  Many of the technological problems are related to the interconnection and integration of heterogeneous systems, particularly when crossing national boundaries and using systems provided by a multiplicity of suppliers. The key issues are: - The expected end-to-end performance capabilities of the applications across the different networks for both local and remote access. Of particular interest is the question of under what conditions does ATM provide a lower end-to-end delay than primary rate ISDN; - The tariffing structure appropriate for ensuring that the provision of such a system will be commercially viable for all suppliers concerned and remain attractive to customers; - The suitability of this technology for providing a meaningful learning experience to students in comparison to more traditional methods; - Copyright and security issues of a distributed client-server application (potentially Europe-wide)."

Under strong power infrared lighting, the weak non-linear emissions (transmitted or reflected by the materials) will be filtered and analysed, in the time and frequency domain, to derive the non-linear polarizability and relaxation time. Besides this, to extend this infrared non-linear spectroscopy in another frequency range, the 10 microns pumping sources will be converted in the 5 microns region, by means of efficient non-linear materials as proustite.  To attain this objective a tuneable 10 microns laser will be built, totally free from spurious non-linear signals and with a few-nanosecond pulse duration. In a further approach a CO2 amplified, picosecond ten microns pulse will be obtained by means of parametric conversion of a near infrared source, so that the dynamics of the non-linear effects can be analysed in the picosecond range. Alternatively, the ten microns sub-nanosecond pulse can be directly extracted from a high pressure CO2 oscillator by means of a neodymium laser. All these sources will be converted at 5 microns wavelength to perform the same non-linear spectroscopy in another frequency range.

Development of a methodology and an accompanying operation tool|SLAM aims at developing a methodology and a tool for the operational support of the Local Authority in the medium-term analysis of a traffic network from the point of view of energy consumptions and emissions and to identify possible remedial actions to improve the overall network energy savings and efficiency. Specifically the SLAM methodology will allow: - to analyse and identify the energy consumption levels due to network traffic flows and characterise the main urban zones in terms of the identified traffic energy indicators; - to support the municipal technical staff in the evaluation of transport remedial interventions from the point of view of global energy consumptions and emissions. The methodology requires: - a conceptual level; - a operational level; - a normative/administrative level.  For evaluating mobility condition as well as energy consumption and emissions in the medium-term in order to take appropriate remedial actions several kinds of data are necessary to Local Authorities. Mobility and environmental data are available in real-time through automated data collection systems installed in urban centres (e.g. traffic control systems,pollution monitoring systems,etc.). Territorial data are available through data banks which provide socio/economic characterisations of an area.What is lacking is an integration of such different information into coherent framework which could enable an evaluation of the impact of traffic flows on the overall energy consumption in the urban area and provide support for effective decisions and interventions on mobility in the short/medium term. The above technological scenario, which provides a significant set of data and parameters (traffic flows,pollution levels,mobility demand,transit times,etc.) in Florence is already active and it is on going enhancement by the activation of THERMIE-JUPITER project. The management services available in the city centre are composed of several monitoring and control systems (Urban Traffic Control - UTC, automatic Vehicle monitoring- AVM, Emission Pollution Monitoring -EPRM, Variable Message Signs- VMS, etc.). The main activities planned in SLAM are the following: - analysis and identification of energy sources and indexes,pollution sources,environmental quality parameters,territorial features which characterise the urban network; - realization of an integrated information base with data provided by the referenc'e technological scenario; - set up and assembly a software tool through the integration of different models (Energy consumption,diffusion,composition identification) and simulation packages (Model assignment,Traffic microsimulator) with the above information base; - analysis and design of an intervention methodology and its interactions with the above software tools allowing to identify remedial transport actions from the point of view of network energy efficiency; - laboratory testing of the implemented environment (methodology and support tools) on real data collected in test area; - analysis and assessment of results (introduction aspects,impacts,operability,technicians acceptance,etc.) Accordingly, SLAM is organised in 9 main work packages (WP) addressing the above kind of activities.

Microbial communities in litter and soil|The present project is developed to analyze microbial litter decomposition in order to define parameters influencing decomposition rate and to identify the microbial populations and their activity.   Decomposition of plant litter is addressed through a combined effort of microbiologists, soil scientists and chemists. It is the aim to analyze the organic matter decomposition via population dynamics, changes in biomass and C and N pools and through humus fractionation, and also to identify indicator populations of functions to be used for assessing changes in land use.  The function and structure of microbial communities on litter and in soil is analyzed as a function of litter quality and quantity and under influence of soil physical and chemical factors with emphasis on water content and temperature. The plan for the project includes two agricultural soil types - silty and sandy - and a climate gradient from Denmark, through Bavaria and Austria to southern Italy. As organic substrate all participants will use a special maize litter enriched with 15N.  The actual decomposition experiments will be conducted as laboratory experiments as well as field testing. The controlled laboratory experiments with and without mixing of maize litter into the soil allow easy sampling including emission of CO2 and N2O. The field experiments will be less frequently sampled but will be helpful in understanding the decomposition processes on a larger scale.  The analytical work consists of fungal and bacterial isolation, identification and biomass determination, directly and by SIR-methods. Fumigation will be used for biomass determination and for extraction of C and N pools. Isotopic analysis will be used for determination of C and N pools and turn over and humus fractionation used for identifying the dynamics of decomposition.

The research in advanced actuator design showed promising results for the piezo-ceramic based actuators and electrodynamic shakers. Flight test with the Dornier 328 as well as the ground tests in the Saab 340 ground test section in combination with loudspeakers showed very good results. However, for future applications of these approaches the actuators need more power.  The results obtained using speaking panels in real flight are very encouraging. Additional works are needed to overcome the two phenomena high driving voltage and some non-linear behaviour in order to raise this technology to an industrial state.  Neural network and genetic algorithm modelling has provided good locations of sensors and actuators at lower computation costs than others analytical algorithms.  Extensive testing and detailed F.E-modelling was performed in order to construct accurate vibro-acoustic models of the structural and acoustical responses. The results obtained during Saab 340 ground test section showed excellent reductions and the feasibility of this approach.  During the study 4 control algorithms were designed and selected for ground and flight tests: The robust vibration control algorithm exhibited good convergence characteristics both for rectified frame element and in the ATR42 mock-up tests. The twin-reference algorithm has proven to be valuable even in flight conditions with the synchrophaser turned off. The results of Saab 340 mock-up tests showed the need of multiple reference algorithms for real applications. The remote microphone algorithm, capable of reducing noise at positions well away from the error microphones, reaches noise reductions very close to those achieved with a LMS algorithm. The robust acoustic control algorithm was able to reduce the noise field significantly even during fast changes in RPM and during flight with different propellor RPM.  In total three different full scale test campaigns were conducted at the end of the project, successfully verifying various different advanced developments in the field of active noise control.

The project evaluates the abiotic and biotic (through enzymatic catalysis) binding of pesticides on characterized clays, humic materials, and clay-humic complexes. The persistence of free and immobilized pesticides under soil biological activity (bioavailability for indigenous and introduced microorganisms) as well as the abiotic release of pesticides bound to different matrices and their mobility in soils will be tested. Furthermore, the ability of free and immobilized enzymes to intervene in the bioremediation of contaminated soils will be verified.  In the project, particular attention will be devoted to:  - determine a) the adsorption capacity, the specificity or non specificity of the different adsorbents models for certain pesticides; b) the reversibility/non-reversibility of the adsorption/desorption process; c) the effect of the surface properties of adsorbents on the above mentioned processes; d) the type of chemical bonding and the active centres of the surface adsorbents models involved; e) the chemical and thermal stability of the clay-complexes obtained.  - characterize the nature, chemical composition, physico-chemical and surface properties of organo-mineral complexes prepared by using two isolated and characterized humic substances and two clay minerals; identify the preferential disposition of humic macromolecules in the clay-humic complexes.  - purify laccases at high purity degree from select fungal strains; obtain laccase preparations temperature-resistant and active in non aqueous solvents and evaluate the detoxifying activity of laccase preparates, alone or in cooperation with other enzymes, in the task of bound residues.  - prepare pesticide-humic and pesticide-clay-humic complexes by adsorption isotherm techniques, abiotic and biotic binding under selected experimental conditions; describe and quantify the kinetics of adsorption and binding processes.  - analyze the pesticide-complexes by C-13 NMR, massa spectrometry and electronic impact method in order to identify the main components of the humic substances and the predominant type of crosslinking present in the solid state; correlate the changes of structural features and chemical composition obtained by spectroscopic methods and the size of molecular aggregates as obtained by the molecular weight distributions.  - isolate bacterial degraders of pesticides and raise resistant mutants; measure rates and amounts of biodegradation (with and without adsorbents and pesticides complexes) following inoculation and quantify microbial growth rates and yields; identify the responses of the soil indigenous microflore to pesticides and inoculants.  - quantify and determine how various soil environments such as pH, moist-dry cycles, and temperature affect the abiotic release of free and bound pesticides under saturated flow conditions.

This project will investigate the influence of pressure on the formation of soot and pyrolysis compounds. New optical and sampling techniques will be developed for use in hostile highpressure experiments.    The project is composed of three complementary actions:  1. Diagnostics for characterization of pyrolysis products in Diesel spray combustion:  Fluorescence measurements will be performed in high-pressure high-temperature conditions to follow the evolution of heavy molecular weight gaseous products. A multi-image technique that uses only one camera to collect 2 or 4 images of different object fields or the same object field with different wavelength or polarization will be developed. Finally, the characterization of random distributions of intensity level recorded by CCD cameras will be performed to collect statistically significant set of time-resolved images.   2. Chemical sampling of pyrolysis products in a shock tube:  To overcome the sampling issue in shock tube due to short residence times, a modified shock tube where the shocks can be quenched at the properly chosen conditions will be built up. The sampling will be performed when the pressure decay starts. Optical techniques and chemical analysis of the sampled products will be carried out to identify large aromatic structures and their time evolution during the soot inception process.   3. High pressure combustion:  The investigation will consist in burning fuel-rich flames at high pressures and in measuring the maximum concentration of unsaturated hydrocarbons in their reaction zone, as well as the concentration of the hydrocarbons remaining in the burnt gas.  Special attention will be given to the aromatic compounds. At the targeted pressures, classical methods cannot be applied. It will be necessary to compute flame profiles for different conditions and to compare them with experiments.

New space techniques, GPS and Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar, will be developed to integrate the classic techniques of ground deformation measurements and the traditional methods for earthquake prediction such as high precision levelling, tilt monitoring and seismic network. The data-set will be used to determine a 3-D seismotectonic model of the test area.   The capability of Differential GPS measurements to detect small movements will be verified by means of a GPS network of 16 stations, which is planned in Situ. During five in Situ campaigns, the horizontal and vertical components of displacement will be measured. The potentiality of Differential SAR Interferometric technique to identify and to measure the small height variations of observed area will be verified by means of 20 (10 pairs) corner reflectors placed in a grid along lines approximatively orthogonal to SAR spaceborne track. The data collected with space technique will be integrated with the data-set of seismic network and modern means for ground deformation measurements like levelling and tiltmeters.  At present time the Sannio-Matese area is monitored by a seismic network of five telemetric seismographs, three out of which are 3-component stations, of the Vesuvian Observatory and by three seismic stations of the ING (National Institute of Geophysics, Rome) operating in the area. The existing network will be reinforced with five additional 3-component seismic stations. With this number of stations it will be possible to detect low-magnitude events and at the same time to determine accurately epicentres which are substantial factors to define the earthquake sources as well as to draw stress field maps based on focal mechanisms.  High precision levelling will provide the vertical component of ground deformation. A levelling network crossing the chain from Caianello to Campobasso has been planned: this will be formed by 60 benchmarks spaced at about 1 km for a total length of about 60 km. Two in Situ levelling campaigns will be carried out. The tilt monitoring will be used to measure with continuity the crustal movements. Two complete digital tiltmeter systems will be installed in the test area.  The data acquired with the different techniques will be processed and compared to validate the effectiveness of space techniques in detecting small movements. Subsequently, the data collected will be integrated with historical seismic data of the test-site to define a seismotectonic 3-D model. The seismotectonic model together with the observed parameters will be used to verify the feasibility of an observation Network for monitoring precursory phenomena and for predicting earthquakes.

To test and validate field-scale, subcatchment-scale and catchment-scale hydrologic models for the estimation of spatio-temporal characteristics of surface soil moisture.   Data from existing spaceborne platforms (ERS-1 and J-ERS-1 satellite) and their on board active microwave sensors (Synthetic Aperture Radar operating in C and L band) will be used. SAR inversion algorithms for soil moisture derivation will be tested, validated and if necessary improved, for use with data from the mentioned platforms.  The hydrologic modelling strategy includes both numerical and conceptual approaches. The information obtained from remote sensing techniques and hydrologic models about the surface soil moisture at different scales will be used to generate soil moisture maps at the catchment scale.  The research will be conducted in three regions in Europe: Brittany (France), Flanders (Belgium) and Tuscany (Italy). Within each of these regions, experimental catchments are selected for detailed study. A fourth test site near Naples (Italy) is selected as a SAR-soil moisture calibration test site.  During the growing season (May-September) and at the time of the satellite's overpass field surveys will be conducted to collect all relevant information about the surface characteristics required to calibrate the inversion algorithms: soil type, texture, roughness, moisture content, as well as vegetation characteristics: row direction and distance, plant density, phenological stage, plant cover, plant height, leaf area index, canopy structure.  During the spring and summer period of the two years of the project detailed hydrologic data will be collected for the experimental catchments. Based on these data numerical and conceptual hydrologic models will be calibrated to produce estimates of surface soil moisture conditions. During that period a number of SAR images (both ERS-1 and J-ERS-1) will be collected. This will allow for a comparison between remotely sensed soil moisture estimates and estimates based upon the hydrologic models. In the catchments Spot XS data are interpreted to characterize land cover conditions.  Due to the high amount of geographically-related information (topography, soil map, vegetation and land use, SAR images, observed, simulated and estimated soil moisture) which will be required, a database for each of the four test sites will be developed by means of geographic information systems (GIS). The knowledge gained from the experiments and the resulting SAR inversion relationships will be used, together with the catchment scale hydrologic models, to produce seasonal soil moisture maps.

This novel method enables to compile a so called Possible Mechanism based on the species space, the reduction of the possible mechanism by the use of complexity factors limiting the number of bond formation and bond-breaking in one elementary act and by thermochemical kinetic treatment. The resulting Reduced Possible Mechanism is use for the construction of so called Sequence Networks.  This modelling approach has been successfully tried in liquid and gas phase oxidation processes e.g.  the oxidation of ethylbenzene, the oxidation of methane.  The project is aimed at determining the main reaction pathways of hydrocarbon pyrolysis and soot inception.  It is intended to carry out following activities:  - To collect research information of related species space,   elementary reactions and rate parameters obtained from the experiments of the participants of the frame project No. JOU2-CT92-0055, entitled ""Pressure effect on pyrolysis and soot inception""  - To compute Possible Mechanisms based on the previous information. To compute a Possible Reduced Mechanism.

They are thought to have acted as a constructive driving force in evolution and contributed in shaping the human genome by intracellular transposition and by generating hot spots of recombination. Furthermore, some of these elements have acquired cellular function, e. g. in regulation of gene expression. In addition, HERVs represent a reservoir of possibly pathogenic retroviral genes and are believed to be involved in insertion mutagenesis and chromosome rearrangements. In this project we will examine the cromosomal distribution and expression of HERVs in order to obtain information on their biological function and pathogenic potential. Furthermore, we expect to obtain more insight in the architecture of the human genome and the role of HERVS in shaping it.  We will isolate HERV sequences that are expressed in normal and malignant human tissues. These will be characterised by sequence analysis and assigned to HERV families. Comparison of various HERV sequences will allow us to understand the phylogeny of HERV families and assist in developing a more definite nomenclature. The chromosomal location of specific HERV sequences and banding profiles of distinct HERV families will be determined and used to develop chromosome-specific markers. We further plan to use HERV sequences for physical mapping of chromosome regions of special interest, e. g. for regions involved in chromosome rearrangements associated with human cancer. HERV cdnas with open reading frames will be expressed in appropriate vectors and antibodies will be generated. The possibility of diagnostic application and the use of these sequences as tumor markers will be evaluated. This project is a joint effort of the major European groups working on HERVS and will cover all important types of HERV elements analysed to date.

Combustion in diesel engines is particularly complicated as it occurs under turbulent and nonpremixed conditions. The propagation of flames in such an environment can be modelled using the ""triple flame"" concept where it is assumed that the flame structure propagates following a surface of stoichiometric mixture.   The objectives of the project are to investigate elementary flame structures for partially premixed combustion from basic principles and to integrate the results into a flamelet library for turbulent combustion.  The role of the coordinator (RWTH Aachen) consists in developing the flamelet concept for partially premixed turbulent combustion and in providing a flamelet library of triple flamelets.  Large-Eddy-Simulations will be applied (U. Karlsruhe) to investigate the structure of partial premixed combustion. The task of U. Napoli will consist in identifying the parameters which can influence triple flame structures and will provide information indicating the temporal statistics and spatial fluid-dynamic structures for which triple flame can be exploited. The contribution of U. Bristol will be to broaden the current concept of laminar triple-flamelets by including flow properties representative of combined stretched vortices and triple flamelet structures of real turbulent partially premixed combustion. Both theoretical and numerical simulations will be used. The Cambridge group will provide experimental benchmark data of triple flame speed, length and width as a function of the fuel concentration gradient and will advise the other partners on suitable boundary conditions. At the U. of Madrid, analysis of the triple flame structure will be generalize to more general kinetic schemes. The four-step kinetic mechanism for methane, found to describe properly the flame dynamics of many typical hydrocarbons, will be evaluated."

Within Greece a large number of the Greek Islands as well as the main land (particularly northern Greece) have been fully evaluated. A significant deposit has been identified at Pentalofos in northern Greece which will be considered for development by Silver and Barytes.   BGS investigated the possibility of upgrading the zeolite content by beneficiation of the zeolite tuffs. In addition they carried out some comparative studies with zeolites from the UK (Northern Ireland) and Brazil (funded under a separate study). The testwork indicated that beneficiation was not suitable for the Greek zeolites as the increase in zeolite content was minimal and could not justify the costs involved.   A number of potential applications for natural zeolites have been investigated:  Silver and Barytes instigated a study on zeolites for swine nutrition ie as an additive to the feed for pigs. This has proved to be very successful and S&B intend to exploit this throughout the EU.  TITAN Cement investigated the use of zeolites as a cement/concrete additive. Again this work was very successful for certain grades of cement products. However, the price of the raw materials, to be supplied by S&B, is such that it is not economic except for very special grades of cement where the market is relatively small. TITAN will continue to investigate the possibility that there are sources of natural zeolites which are better located for their cement works and, therefore, could be made available at a lower price.  A-Z Analytical Services have completed an investigation for the use of natural zeolites to remove ammonia from fish farming waters. A-Z have identified a large market in the UK and are considering how to exploit this.  SEREP have carried out testwork on a number of applications relating to the treatment of liquid effluents. Five objectives were identified for the use of natural zeolite:  1. as an adsorbing device  2. as a platform for bacteria  3. in the treatment of oil-water after chemical transformation of zeolite onto oleophilic material  4. for filtration  5. for assisted flocculation  The first three of these appear to be of significant technical interest for industrial implementation, whereas the two other applications, do not appear to be of any interest, either from a technical viewpoint or from an economic aspect. Zeolite deposits are known to exist in Europe, particularly in the Mediterranean area. This Industrial Research project is directed at characterising a number of Mediterranean deposits of natural zeolites, separation of the pure natural zeolites from these deposits and investigations of the chemical an physical properties related to their potential for a number of applications. By combining geological and mineralogical studies with work on beneficiation and on chemical and physical characterisation; it is hoped to establish the suitability and availability of natural zeolites in Europe for a range of applications. The major research tasks which will be carried out during the programme are:  A). Determination of the compositional variation of zeolites in known sedimentary, zeolite deposits in Europe and their suitability for the extraction of pure natural zeolites.  B). Investigate the possibility of establishing further economic deposits of zeolites.  C). Determine the mineralogy of the zeolites from the deposits under evaluation.  D). Obtain core samples and establish methods of beneficiation.  E). Evaluate the potential of the natural zeolites by examination of their physical and chemical properties for selected applications, particularly for the removal of heavy metals, and for use in aquaculture and animal nutrition.  F). Carry out a market study based on the results of the testwork.  During the last 20 years it has been realised that thre are many zeolite occurrences in sedimentary rocks in Europe, However, unlike North America and Japan, pure natural zeolites are not yet produced within Europe to any major extent. European industry is thus forced to import natural zeolites or use less acceptable synthetic zeolites. This research project will endeavour to establish the composition of a number of European zeolyte deposits an their potential application, to provide industry with the background information necessary for the detailed development prior to commercial exploitation.  This proposal is multi-sectoral covering the fields of mining, mineral processing, waste treatment cement production, swine nutrition and aquaculture.

The principal activities of the project are as follows:  Four case study sets of buildings will be selected in the following cities which are: Lisbon, Rhodes City, Naples, Carpineto Spinello (Abruzzo).  In the first three cases, the case study building sets will consist mainly of residential/commercial buildings, chosen to be representative of the historically important and earthquake vulnerable building stock of the city. In all cases, a method of collection of the data will be agreed by the participants. A vulnerability analysis and a comparative study of alternative vulnerability methods will be undertaken. For each case study location, a geographical database will be built.  Each participant will identify the principal retrofit strengthening techniques in use, in their own area. Data on earthquake damage to masonry buildings and historic town centres will be assembled (in particular to previously strengthened buildings). Vulnerability methodologies will be developed so that they can evaluate the effect on vulnerability of the key retrofit techniques identified above.  For each case study a proposed strategy for cost-effective strengthening will be proposed, and presented to a local meeting.  The main deliverables of this research project will be: A comparative analysis of vulnerability methods for old buildings in historic city centres presently in use and new methods of vulnerability assessment applicable to strengthened masonry buildings, as well as, associated computer programmes. A compilation of data on earthquake damage to strengthened historical buildings and on retrofit strengthening techniques in use or available for use in historic European city centres.

100|grant.3706709|BIO2930394; 6119|Development of a new test of developmental toxicology|Development of a new test of developmental toxicology|Development of a new test for developmental toxicology with the aim to substantially decrease the number of living mammals which would be used for the same purpose. To this aim a multisystem biological approach was developed by testing at least 5 drugs at different concentrations within the range of human serum concentration in therpy. Further experiments were carried out about gene expression under the effect of several drugs, essentially the same as described before and about the effect on the offspring. These effects were found in all the systems which constitute our 'multisystem developmental toxicology test'. Namely: a) sea urchin embryos Prof. Giudice found by in situ hybridization that after treatment with valproate, which induces exogastrulation, the location in the zygote of the product of one maternal gene relevant the establishment of the animal-axis, like bep 1, is changed b) Dictyostelium discoideum. It was established that the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum can be used as a model system to evaluate acute and developmental toxicity of chemicals and drugs. Cell growth, cell volume impaired chemotaxis delayed develompent and impaired expression of developmentally regulated genes were selected as endpoints. The system has been tested with valproic acid and teratogenic and non-teratogenic derivatives. It responds exactly as the well documented embryonic mouse model. c) Drosophila 1) Prof. Polito has extended to methotrexate and diazepam the observation that intrabdominal injection of the above drugs into adult Drosophila transgenic phemales produces a change in the pattern of expression of the beta gal reporter gene in the ovaries. NOC niclei oocytes; NNCEV nuclei nurse cells early vitellogenesis; NNCLV Nuclei nurse cells late vitellogenesis; Nuclei germarium cells; OOP ooplasm; NFC nuclei follicular cells. Minus and plus signs show the levels of beta-galactosidase. The drug is given microinjecting the product to test into adult females of Drosophila. A volume of 400 nl a solution of different concentration was injected in adult fly abdomen for any drug to be tested and in the pictures is shown the amount of drug injected.  2) Prof. Morata found that intrabdominal injection of normal adult Drosophila females with Phenytoin produces aberration in 5-8% of larvae and of valproate in 10% of these. Valproate also induces increase of apoptosis expecially in the cephalic regions. d) Yeast: Prof. Planta calculated the IC50 values for Doxorubicin, Dactinomycin, Valproate (VPA), 4-yn VPA and 2en VPA under standardized growth conditions, respiratory or fermentatives taking as end point the increase in number of cells. Clear effects were found for all the drugs tested and much lower effect for analogs known to be non toxic in humans, therefore stressing the sensitivity and specificity of the system for hydrosoluble drugs. Attempts were made to make the system suitable also for hydrofobic drugs (like phenytoin), by adding to the culture medium 1% DMSO and 0,2% oleate. Under these conditions most hydrofobic drugs remain in solution in the medium. e) Human keratinocytes: Dr. Pellegrini has tried the effect of thalidomide and phenotoin on these cultures and found no effect. Dosage of internal metabolites suggests an alternative pathway of these drugs in epidermis than in other tissues. f) Drug dosage. Prof. Caccia has measured the concentration of the tested drugs and metabolites in ovaries and carcasses of Drosophila after injection in the fly abdomen. It was found that Drosophila metabolizes these drugs through metabolic pathways similar to those of mammals.  MAJOR SCIENTIFIC BREAKTHROUGHS: It was confirmed that our 'multisystem approach' is suitable, as previously suggested, as an alternative to living mammals, for studies of developmental toxicology, for hydrosoluble drugs, and may be, with some modifications suggested by the last experiments, also for hydrofobic ones.
100|grant.3704989|BIO2930400; 6207|Plant molecular genetics for an environmentally compatible agriculture|Plant molecular genetics for an environmentally compatible agriculture|The EU Biotechnology Programme (1992-94) work programme invited applications for the establishment of Projects of Technology Priority (PTP) that would secure added value for European R&D activities by helping participants in complementary projects covering different technologies of the EU supported research programme to coordinate their activities around specific objectives. The PTP project 'Plant Molecular Genetics for an Environmentally Compatible Agriculture' was therefore conceived and implemented by AMICA to provide more scientific knowledge relevant to an environmentally sustainable agriculture, a topic of importantance for all of the member states as well as helping to enhance the continued competitiveness of European agriculture and related industries in the global market place. The project was established as a large multi-thematic programme, concentrating the scientific work programme around 15 research themes, and three local training involving 130 collaborating research teams from 11 member states. In fulfilment of the Biotechnology work programme, AMICA installed high levels of internal organisation to promote the development of the R&D infrastructure, the allocation of tasks to individual participants, the inclusion of training activities, and support to deserving groups penalized by geographic or academic isolation. Detailed final reports from each of these transnational, multidisciplinary collaborating groups of laboratories are contained elsewhere in this report. In addition to organising and managing the scientific programme of the PTP, AMICA instigated a range of management tasks which were inherent to the successful execution of the project. This PTP coordination overview will concentrate on these modalities, and highlight how added value and other benefits were realised, as well as noting some of the major scientific breakthroughs achieved during the contractual period. Scientific Highlights The breeding of plants for a more efficient, useful and environmentally compatible agriculture depends on creating plants with different growth habits, the ability to withstand better environmental stresses created by temperature and chemical variation, better abilities to sequester fertilisers from soils and better quality fruits and seeds for industrial processing and nutrition. The PTP has made many discoveries to enrich the fast growing pool of information that industries will use to breed new versions of crops with these improvements. Examples of some outstanding scientific success stories are detailed below: (i) Modern breeding has given us high yielding hybrids, e.g. of maize (by crossing of some highly inbred lines). This phenomenon, known as heterosis, is well known but poorly understood. This programme attempts to correlate the capacity for high yield with the activity, or lack thereof, of certain genes. (ii) That plant pathogenic bacteria harbour hrp (host resistance and pathogenicity) genes, some of which are highly conserved and related to genes found in animal pathogens and therefore renamed hrc (c for conserved), is not only very intriguing but the comparison also strengthens the idea that these genes are involved in a mechanism allowing the injection in the plant of chemical signals coming from the pathogenic bacteria. The importance of this work is to be measured in a medium to long-term time frame. (iii) Plants have evolved regulated growth systems to compete with each other for sunlight. In agriculture this is not always advantageous. Transgenic tobacco plants expressing an oat PHYA gene have now been produced and shown to exhibit negative shade avoidance characteristics with reduced extension growth of stems and petioles when grown in close proximity to other plants. This manipulation of crop plant architecture has resulted in an significant increase in leaf biomass. Field trials have been carried out to advance this discovery. (iv) The correct timing of flower formation and appropriate flower structures are a vital determinant of seed yield. Consequently flowering is being studied in detail. A gene involved in flower development has been isolated from barley. Remarkably this gene (Tumbra) shows similarity to tumour genes from humans and mice. The expression of this gene is connected to tumorous growth in plants indicating similarities between the growth of tumours in both plants and animals. The gene may be useful to help control plant cell proliferation and differentiation in plant propagation regimes. (v) It is well known that steroids play a major influence on the development of animals. Through the analysis of a T-DNA insertion mutant of Arabidopsis affected in its growth, as well as its reactions to light, PTP research has demonstrated that certain ecdysone-like steroids (brassinosteroids) also play a major role in the regulation of a wide range of agriculturally important traits in plants (growth, defense mechanisms and reactions to light). (vi) Plant growth is regulated by hormones such as ethylene. Manipulation of responses to hormones depends on defining the genes and pathways associated with the ethylene growth response. Studies have now demonstrated that binding of ethylene to its receptor within the plant, results in the activation of a small protein termed a G-protein. It has also been shown that the treatment of plants with ethylene leads to the initiation of a 'phosphorylation cascade' that activates steps that eventually change plant behaviour. Such observations have great significance because the small G-protein/phosphorylation cascade systems are known to be central to the control of many aspects of metabolism and development in yeast and animals, including humans. This is supported by the fact that 80% of human cancers are thought to be due to malfunctions of genes encoding small G-proteins. The plant discovery opens up ways of manipulating many aspects of plant architecture and responses. (vii) Xyloglucan oligosaccharides (XGOs) are natural plant growth regulators. PTP research has shown that XGOs promote plant growth by 'plasticising' cell walls, induce the production of ethylene, and can move from one part of the plant to another. This knowledge is confirming these molecules as powerful initiators of changes in plant growth patterns. PTP supported work has also demonstrated how a recently discovered enzyme, xyloglucan endotransglycosylase, which plays a major role in XGO action, acts in living plant cells to modify XGO structures. (viii) A dream of plant breeders is to be able to disrupt specific genes and replace them with new versions. This has so far proved very inefficient in higher plants. Work using Physcomitrella patens as a model species has demonstrated for the first time efficient gene disruption in plants. Disruption of genes encoding adenine phosphoribosyl transferase and the chlorophyll a/b binding protein has been achieved. Gene targeting permits the possibility of disrupting the activity of genes in order to ascertain their precise function - something vital for the research community in this era of gene discovery. (ix) Proteins and compounds such as certain sugars or amino acids derivatives are thought to exert a synergistic effect in protecting plant cells from irreversible damage caused by different abiotic stresses. In determining how the synthesis of these compounds is regulated the PTP has identified a barley protein that is synthesised in response to cold stress. It is a useful marker for breeders to measure cold tolerance. To discover valuable genes in protecting plants against stress many Arabidopsis mutants have been isolated with altered cold acclimation and freezing tolerance. By inserting specific genes plants with a modified response to heat shock have been made. These are significant advances towards the provision of crop plants with better resistance to common stresses limiting agricultural production. (x) In order to understand how plants respond to potassium (K+) deficiency and high salinity, PTP has characterised the pathways by which plants take up K+ and Na+. It has identified enzymes within the cell that are particularly sensitive to Na+ and show that Na+ sensitive metabolic systems are involved in intracellular signalling and regulate the pathway of active Na+ excretion under high salinity. (xi) To modify the ability of plants to withstand drought stress, it is relevant to understand which genes respond to drought to provide protection. Sixteen have been identified in maize in the PTP project and mapped on the maize genome to explore their coincidence with drought-linked loci detected by classical genetic mapping. Also decreases in invertase have shown to be an important early response to mild water stress. (xii) Significant advances have been made in the analysis of starch synthesis in the potato tuber with the identification of proteins involved in determining the structural features of starch. Potato plants with modified starches have been produced by manipulation of genes encoding the proteins. This information can be applied by industry to produce specific starch types suited to the needs of specialised end-users. (xiii) In an attempt to produce 'nutrient-dense foods' the PTP has been looking into how to increase the amounts of carotenoids in certain food crops. Many appropriate genes that can be introduced into plants in order to increase the amounts and types of carotenoids have been identified. Transformation of tomato with carotenoid biosynthesis genes from bacteria has been accomplished to make tomatoes with novel carotenoids. Also our fundamental understanding of the mechanisms in plants that control the level of these pigments in plant tissues has been increased. (xiv) Bacterial genes specifying fructans have been inserted into sugar beet and plants created that synthesise fructans. This discovery opens up new commercial potential for fructan production in this crop. (xv) Major genetic factors regulating kernel development and the utilisation of nitrogen in cereals have been identified to aid improved seed production. (xvi) An important objective for agriculture is to optimise the uptake of NO3 fertiliser to enable different fertiliser regimes to be practised. Genes for membrane proteins that are likely components of the high affinity nitrate uptake system of barley have been isolated. The equivalent genes have also been identified from other plant species which will enable scientists to improve the efficiency in which crop plants capture nitrate from the soil. (xvii) The identification of the high affinity transporters for nitrate opens the way to devise transgenic plants more efficiently taking up nitrate from the soil. This can be envisaged as a strategy to reduce the needs in nitrate fertilisers for major crops. (xviii) Plants constitutively expressing nitrate reductase are less susceptible to water stress-induced depression of nitrate assimilation. This also can contribute to devise plants requiring less nitrate for their sustained growth in semi arid conditions. (xix) Research carried out by one of the local training networks has resulted in the development of cDNA probes that can determine the developmental phase of tree material, which will act as a valuable tool in, (i) selection of tree material for micropropagation and (ii) determination of phase status prior to rooting and weaning. The PTP has also played an important role in helping to integrate the activities of geographically isolated groups with the rest of the European plance sceince community. As a direct result of the integrated collaboration between the Irish network and PTP Scientific Programme, the first European technology transfer meeting in plant biotechnology Phytosfere '97, was successfully held at University College Dublin. This meeting was a collaborative effort between AMICA, PIP, BioResearch Ireland and University College Dublin. (xx) As a consequence of the fruitful cooperation established between researchers in Portugal and the other members of the PTP, and of the expertise acquired in plant molecular biology, several papers are being prepared. A confidential abstract to discuss the possibility patenting of one gene sequence has been submitted to the Plant Industrial Platform.

The objectives of the work are to operate and optimize the performance of two laboratory scale pyrolysis reactors in order to derive an optimum configuration and jointly develop a common modelling procedure for scale-up. Associated objectives include assessment of the potential to recover high value speciality chemicals and commodities from the liquid products and determination of basic physical and physio-chemical properties. The possibility of using the residual liquid as an alternative fuel will also be assessed as valorization of this material is essential for economic viability of an integrated process.   Two different 5kg/h ablative pyrolysis reactors have been constructed and commissioned. A thorough and intensive experimental programme is necessary to compare, evaluate and optimise the reactors' performance. A common approach to product collection system involving direct quenching of the product vapours is being designed and constructed. The results show that high yields of liquids up to 75 wt% can be obtained. The benefits of this approach compared to conventional flash pyrolysis are a more compact reactor design with correspondingly reduced equipment costs, higher heat transfer coefficients and higher specific throughput. Information on the yields of solid char, liquids and gases will allow models to be developed with the University of Naples for ablative pyrolysis to assist in further design work for the engineering scale-up by both Aston and Twente Universities. An essential part of the design process for new technologies is robust modelling of the reaction phenomena. This aspect of the project will develop existing models and apply them to the pyrolysis processes under investigation. The joint development of related technologies at Aston and Twente will permit more comprehensive and thorough models to be developed. These will aid scale-up, optimization, and provide more reliable designs.   The pyrolysis liquid contains a wide variety of highly oxygenated organic compounds. Some chemicals can be recovered by direct extraction, and there is potential in catalytic upgrading to specific products or families of compounds. All work to date has focused on de-oxygenation for liquid fuels by hydrotreating or zeolite cracking. This work will examine novel catalyst systems to exploit the state of the art and develop new catalysts, new products and new processes. The work will utilize a continuous microreactor system for rapid screening of a range of modified conventional and novel catalysts.   Physio-chemical properties are essential for design and scale up of flash pyrolysis and upgrading systems and specification of applications. There is no data available on any relevant properties, and extrapolation of data on orthodox hydrocarbons can lead to major over-or under-design with correspondingly technical uncertainties and economic consequences. Products from both pyrolysers and upgrading work will be examined and compared to other pyrolysis liquids and products.

100|grant.3705967|BIO2930274; 5837|Biotechnology of extremophiles|Biotechnology of extremophiles|Extremophiles have tremendous potential in biotechnology because of their ability to grow under extreme conditions and to produce unique stable products with high technological value. By integrating the activities of 39 expert laboratories we were able to isolate and characterize a variety of novel microorganisms that can survive under extreme conditions (extremes of temperature, pH and high salt concentrations). Using an interdisciplinary research activities involving microbiologists, biochemists, chemists and engineers cell yields up to 132 g/l (cell dry weight) were obtained. This was a prerequisite for the isolation and production of various products such as enzymes, lipids and organic solutes that are of interest for various industrial applications. The structure-function relationship of enzymes from extremophiles such as glutamate dehydrogenase and hydrolases were studied. The analysis of the three dimensional structure of a number of enzymes from extremophiles lead to the elucidation of the principle of thermostability and salt tolerance. Novel compatible solutes were identified in extremophiles and were found to have a positive effect on the stabilization of enzymes. Gene regulation and control could be studied in detail in many representatives of extremophiles and the mechanisms involved in energy transduction were elucidated. Due to the interdisciplinarity and collaborative interaction of the project leaders and their coworkers, these major scientific breakthroughs have been achieved. This is documented by 103 joint publications (270 in total) in international scientific journals and the exchange of students and scientists.  Isolation and development of fermentation technology Laser microscope (optical tweezers) was successfully applied for the isolation of Archaea and Bacteria. By applying this fast technique five different thermoacidophilic strains were isolated from smouldering slag heaps in Sweden. Gram-negative sulphur oxidizing alkaliphilic bacteria and Actinomycetes were isolated from soda lake samples from Siberia and East Africa. Furthermore, microorganisms were isolated from Lake Bogoria that are able to grow at high temperatures (60-80(C) and pH values (9.5-11.0). The MEE (Multilocus Enzyme Electrophoresis) method has been developed and found to be both rapid and reliable for the classification of thermophiles. The phylogentic position of extremely halophilic archaea isolated from the Dead Sea was also determined. Cultivation of hyperthermophiles was performed in dialysis batch, gas-lift bioreactors as well as by complete cell recycling with cross-flow filtration techniques. By fermenting the organism in a dialysis membrane bioreactor a dramatic increase in the maximal cell density (3.5E10 cells/ml, O.D. 6.0) could be observed. The influence of various medium components such as sugars, amino acids and vitamins on growth of the hyperthermophiles Pyrococcus furiosus, Pyrococcus abyssi and Aquifex pyrophilus was investigated. Cheaper industrial grade substrates were identified and over 1 kg of pyrococcal cell paste was produced in gas lift reactors. The cultivation of the hyperthermophile Pyrococcus furiosus, the thermoacidophile Sulfolobus shibatae and the halophile Marinococcus M52 in dialysis membrane reactors resulted in cell yields of 2.6, 114 and 132 g/l (cell dry weight), respectively. These results demonstrate that cultivation of extremophiles to high cell densities can be achieved if modern fermentation technology is employed.  Unique enzymes from extremophiles Amylase from the hyperthermophile Pyrococcus woesei, which is an interesting enzymes for the starch industry, was purified, characterized and its gene was cloned in the mesophilic hosts Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. The pullulanase from the same Archaeon was crystallized and used to collect a native and two derivative intensity data sets by X-ray diffraction. The glutamate dehydrogenase from this model organism was also crystallized and studied in detail. The comparative analysis of the structures of pyrococcal and clostridial GluDH revealed a major role for ion pair networks in maintaining enzyme stability. Crystals of Alcohol dehydrogenase from Sulfolobus solfataricus were prepared for further analysis. The beta-glycosidase has been recently crystallized and the 3D structure has been resolved at 2.6 A. In addition the DNA polymerase, an interesting enzyme for PCR technology, from Sulfolobus solfataricus was cloned and expressed in E. coli. In order to understand the basis of protein thermostability the hexameric GluDH from Pyrococcus furiosus and glutamate dehydrogenase have been investigated. The refolding pathway was analyzed, the assembly intermediates were identified and their formation rate constants were calculated. The detailed characterzation of archaeal-bacterial hybrid showed that thermal and chemical stability may be uncoupled. Chaperonin from Sulfolobus solfataricus has been shown to promote correct folding of several thermophilic and mesophilic enzymes from their chemical denatured state by preventing aggregation of refolded intermediates or native enzymes. The two enzymes adenylate kinase and cytosolic pyrophosphatase from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius have been investigated. Both genes were successfully expressed in E. coli and the proteins were crystallized. The thermostable xylanase, which has application potential in biopulping, from Rhodothermus marinus has been successfully synthesized in E. coli. Other polymer degrading enzymes such as protease and amylase were studied from newly isolated psychrophylic microbes. Both enzymes have been purified and characterized. Alkali stable and thermostable amylase and pullulanase have been identified from a newly isolated thermoalkaliphile which represent a new taxon Thermopallium natronophilum. In addition, the most thermostable cellulase known so far has been purified from Rhodothermus marinus. The P. furiosus genes for a novel endoglucanase and several alcohol dehydrogenases have been determined and functionally expressed. Also the serine protease (pyrolysin) has been purified and the pls gene coding for this pre-pro-protein has been completely sequenced. Two DNA topoisomerases were purified from P. furiosus. Finally, the novel ADP dependent kinase has been purified and characterized.  Metabolism of carbohydrates and production of low molecular weight compounds Glucose metabolism was investigated in seven strains of hyperthermophilic archaea and bacteria using 13C-labelled substrates. Thermococcus tenax and Thermotoga maritima show considerable contributions to both the Embden-Meyerhof and the Entner-Doudoroff pathways, whereas Thermococcus and Pyrococcus strains show 100% Embden-Meyerhof and Sulfolobus strains use exclusively the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. The novel archaeal enzyme involved in acetate formation and ATP synthesis (acetyl-CoA synthetase) was purified from Pyrococcus furiosus and characterized. Several strains of Thermotogales were screened for the presence of solutes (low molecular weight organic compounds). A novel compound derived from di-myo-inositol-phosphate was found in Thermotoga maritima and characterized by NMR. Novel organic solutes (di-glycerol-phosphate, galactosyl-5-hydroxylysine and mannosylglycerate) were identified in archaea and their influence as an enzyme protector against heating and freeze drying was shown. Furthermore, six novel hopanoids, bacteriohopanetetrol glycosides possessing a glycuronic acid moiety, were isolated from a thermophilic Cyanobacterium, Synechococcus sp.  Gene regulation and control In this project it was possible to establish a cell-free transcription system for the hyperthermophile working at 90(C. Two pyrococcal transcription factors were discovered and were found to be related in their structure and function to eucaryotic transcription factors TBP and TFIIB. New plasmids were isolated from Thermococcales and a naturally positively supercoiled plasmid was identified for the first time in vivo. Furthermore, the DNA gyrase from Thermotoga maritima was sequenced and lead to the discovery of a new family of Topo II in hyperthermophilic archaea. An efficient transformation procedure was developed for Pyrococcus which was followed by the development of a shuttle vector between E. coli and P. furiosus. It has been also demonstrated that both the archaeal introns and their genetically engineered derivatives are mobile between hyperthermophiles. Saccharomyces cervisiae was proven to be a particularly adequate host for the expression of the hyperthermophilic P. furiosus OTCase whereas E. coli is not, due to partial proteolysis. Furthermore, a suitable shuttle vector was constructed for moderate halophiles and conjugation was demonstrated. Native promotors from various moderate halophiles were isolated and characterized. DNA fragments influencing osmoregulation were isolated. It has been shown that the differential streptomycin transport efficiency in haloalkaliphilic bacteria was dependent on the ionic strength of the medium.  Membranes, membrane proteins and bioenergetics of Extremophiles The investigations on the bioenergetics of extremophiles have shown that a correlation exists between the optimum growth temperature and the proton permeability of the membrane. To study this phenomenon in further detail liposomes were prepared from lipids derived from various extremophiles grown at various temperatures. Energy transduction was studied in Picrophilus oshimae, a thermoacidophilic archaea that grows optimally at pH 0.7 and 60(C. This archaeon maintains its intracellular pH at 5.0 with the external pH of 0.7. Membranes of this organism were found to be equipped with a low proton permeability that allows proton-linked energy-transduction. It has been also shown that the energy-transduction in the newly isolated anaerobic thermophile strain LBS3 was linked to sodium-cycling. The electron transport complexes (Rieske-FeS proteins, succinate dehydrogenase, terminal heme-copper oxidases) involved in respiratory energy transduction were investigated. Two Rieske-FeS proteins were discovered in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius and their genes were sequenced. Proton pumping by a Q-cycle was found in the terminal oxidase complex of Sulfolobus and two operons encoding the unusual terminal oxidase from Desulfurolobus ambivalens were completely resolved. In addition, Rhodothermus marinus respiratory chain was deeply studied by chemical, spectroscopic and molecular biology tools.

No individual segment was responsible for ligand specificity but the third segment of the AR and PR was important in ligand binding and/or transcriptional activation. Furthermore, natural androgens were found to bind to the AR at sites partially distinct from those of non-steroidal antiandrogens. 2 The retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors bind to direct repeats (DR) as heterodimers with RXR. When the repeats are spaced by 6 base pairs, or less, dimerisation is mediated by both the DNA binding and ligand binding domains but when the repeats are spaced by more than 6 base pairs the dimer interface between the DNA binding domains is not formed. RAR/RXR heterodimers bind in either orientation to such widely spaced repeats; in contrast, RAR binds to the upstream repeat in a DR-1 but the downstream repeat in a DR-5. 3 A number of proteins have been identified that interact with receptors in the presence of ligand. To date full-length cDNA clones have been identified for TIF-1, RIP140, SRC-1/RIP160, SUG-1 and TIF-2. TIF-1 is a ring-finger protein that might have a role in chromatin remodelling. RIP-140 is a novel serine threonine rich nuclear protein of unknown function. Both SRC-1 and TIF-2 stimulate the transcriptional activity of many nuclear receptors and appear to function as coactivators. SUG-1 is a protein that has previously been found as a component of the proteosome and RNA polymerase II holenzyme. 4 The following proteins have been expressed in heterologous systems, purified and shown to be functional: all steroid hormone receptors, TBP, TFIIB and a number of TAFs, nuclear factor 1 (NF1) and octamer transcription factor 1 (OTF1). NF-1 acts as a transcription factor but does not synergise with GR or PR whereas OTF-1 is a weak TF but does synergise with these receptors. Furthermore, a protein that interacts with a GR called GRIP170 also promotes the transcriptional activity of the GR. 5 The mitogenic response of MCF-7 cells to estrogen is accompanied by an increase in cyclin D1 gene transcription. DNA sequences have been mapped within the promoter that are both necessary and sufficient for this effect. The site does not bind ER itself but corresponds to a cell-specific, oestrogen induced factor. 6 Sites in the growth hormone promoter have been mapped that mediate ligand independent activation by TR and RAR. A further enhancement in transcriptional activity in the presence of T3 depends on the transcription factor GHF-1. Vitamin D antagonises the retinoid and T3 induced transcription either by competition for DNA binding sites or sequestration of downstream target proteins or both. The nuclear receptor HNF-4 binds to and regulates transcription of the apoA/C-III/A-IV gene cluster. HNF-1 can antagonise HNF-4 probably by interacting with the LBD of the receptor and blocking AF-2 activity. 7 The low molecular weight urokinase type plasminogen activator has been developed for screening assays employing vitamin D reporters and for analysing expression in individual cells using a casein-agarose overlay. This in vitro technique allows the recovery of such cells for further characterisation. MAJOR SCIENTIFIC BREAKTHROUGHS: 1 Complete description of the response element repertoire of nuclear receptors and their dimerisation properties on these sites. 2 Identification of five proteins that interact with receptors but have distinct functional roles. SRC-1/RIP160, TIF-2 and probably RIP140 function as co activators while TIF-1 may be involved in chromatin remodelling. 3 A cell-free transcription system has been developed using recombinant and/or purified proteins and the ability of GR and PR to synergise with OTF-1 and not NF-1 demonstrated. 4 Development of high throughput, cell-based screening assays for analysing the activity of ER and GR receptors and individual cell-based assays. 5 Identification of the DNA sequences in the cyclin D1 gene required to mediate a mitogenic response to E2 and characterisation of a cell-cycle-specific, oestrogen-regulated transcription factor. 6 Characterisation of the mechanisms by which vitamin D receptors and HNF-1 can antagonise the activity of other nuclear receptors.

The programme makes use of the well-studied aspartate aminotransferase as a prototypic enzyme for which much structural and kinetic information is already available and of thermostable forms of this enzyme from high temperature organisms. Glutamate semialdehyde aminotransferase and glutamate decarboxylase are also under investigation and the solution of the structures of these enzymes by X-ray crystallography is an associated objective. Two mutants of aspartate aminotransferase from Escherichia coli have been produced, one of which has been endowed with alanine racemase activity and the other with b-decarboxylase activity towards L-aspartate. Other mutants have been produced in which the partition ratio between b-elimination and transamination and inactivation have been extensively altered. The structure of glutamate semialdehyde aminotransferase has been solved and mutant forms of the enzyme produced accordingly. The two glutamate decarboxylase genes in E. coli have been separately expressed and the effect of mutating active site histidines has been determined. A mutant of the thermophilic aspartate aminotransferase from Sulfolobus solfataricus enzyme has been created in which a temperature dependent conformational change has been analysed fluorometrically.

To control these emissions, one must first understand how they are formed during the combustion process.   The objective of this project is to contribute to the understanding of soot formation . The project will provide reliable quantitative data about fuel hydrocarbon pyrolysis and soot formation under conditions arising in modern power stations using gas, liquid hydrocarbons, coal dust or slurries in high power combustion chambers and in piston engines. (The operating pressures are about one order of magnitude or more above atmospheric pressure).    Shock tubes and flow reactor studies will be performed in an integrated way for the investigation of the pyrolysis and soot formation from hydrocarbons in high pressure conditions.   In order to quantify the pyrolysis and the growth of particles it will be necessary to perform shock tube experiments for carbon densities from 8 1016 to 2- 1019 C atoms per cm3. In these experiments absorption measurements in the wavelength range from 2000 Å into the infrared, and light scattering measurements will be used. These measurements will be supplemented by chemical analysis of the reaction products. For the investigation of pyrolysis in fuel sprays injected in a flow reactor analogous measurement techniques will be exploited.  They will be extended by using two-dimensional imaging of the spray and of the soot particles in the pyrolytic regions.   The research programme is divided in three parallel parts:  a) Shock tube experiment up to 50 bar (Istituto Motori, CNR) : Mixtures of vaporized and gaseous aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons will be introduced, at different C/O ratios, for studying soot and precursor formation up to 50 bar.   b) Shock tube experiment up to 200 bar (University of Göttingen) : The pyrolysis experiments in homogeneous mixtures will be performed in shock waves-incident and reflected. For the measurements of temperature and pressure the initial shock conditions and accurate shock velocity measurements will be used.   c) High pressure flow reactor (University of Naples) :   The determination of the chemical and physical parameters controlling soot and paralytic products formation will be performed in different spatial and temporal regions of a spray injected in the high pressure flow reactor. The part of the process controlled by chemical kinetics will be analyzed changing the chemical composition of the fuel, keeping constant the physical fuel characteristics.   In complement, Prof. Nemeth (Hungarian Acad. Sci.) will contribute in compiling possible mechanisms, find reducing methods to establish a Sequence Network and evaluate the results by computer simulation.

This allows a full comparison between a large number of different experiments carried out by many different techniques in the three laboratories. We can draw conclusions on four different areas:  Methodologies: light scattering can be effectively used for morphology measurements (size distribution on droplet morphologies, use of transient morphologies to evaluate size and interfacial tension). High resolution optical microscopy/image analysis was developed and rheological tests can be used to measure morphology size.  Deformation of an existing morphology: drop deformation was monitored in shear by many different techniques (optical microscopy, light scattering, dichroism, shear stress, first normal stress difference, oscillatory rheology). Drop deformation was modelled and the results were successfully compared with experiments. An improved model of drop retraction was produced, giving a better estimate of interfacial tension. Stress predictions were obtained with an affine model and the Napoli model.  Change of morphology: the relative contributions of morphology breaking and coalescence were assessed and the direct evidence of these two mechanisms was shown in transient rheology and rheo-optics. There is a good understanding of break-up at rest and during flow at low concentrations. An extensive set of data on coalescence was generated.  Influence of a liquid crystalline phase: no measurable influence of the liquid crystalline character of one phase on interfacial tension or morphology was seen. The aim of the present proposal is to replace the current empiricism for controlling the morphology of incompatible polymer blends by a scientifically based approach which implies a fundamental understanding of the evolution of the microstructure during processing. This goal will be achieved by designing the necessary experimental tools to quantitatively characterize the morphology in various types of flows. The obtained results will be used to develop models having these morphological parameters built in and to control the microstructure, the functionality and the properties of polymer blends. Moreover, this work will also contribute to a more effective development of new materials. In addition, innovative instruments will be developed to probe the flow-induced structures.  In order to achieve these goals, the following tasks will be performed :  - designing model compounds which reproduce the various morphologies found in industrial blends under conditions suitable for optical observations during flow and where the major governing parameters can be varied systematically.  - designing new rheo-optical devices specifically tailored for the investigation of multiphase polymers. - performing rheological and in-situ characterization (optical microscopy, small-angle light scattering, conservative dichroism...) of morphologies in various flow conditions (shear, elongation; complex 2D and 3D flows). - developing mathematical models to be used in industrial process optimization and materials design.

The following results have been achieved:  The possibility of reducing tonal low frequency interior noise in helicopters by up to 12 dB with Active Noise Control has been demonstrated for the first time in flight.  Methods to identify noise transmission paths and vibratory source descriptors have been validated in flight, demonstrating that gearbox noise dominant transmission path is structureborne.  The potential benefits of actively controlling the transmissibility of gearbox support struts (as well as passive means such as a tuned resonator and elastomeric bearings) and structural panels have been lab-demonstrated. The combination of active control and elastomeric bearings showed a reduction of up to 40dB in the transmissibility of the strut, while panel control achieved up to 15dB reductions in radiated noise.  A predictive SEA code has been developed and lab validated on a real ""green"" helicopter fuselage.  A study on the characterisation of the most influential parameters (including errors and misalignments) in noise emission by gears has been performed. A reference noise level of 75 dBA has been identified by the European helicopter manufacturing industries as realistically achievable within a time scale of 5 years.   The objective of this project is to approach the noise reduction problem on helicopters following a global and systematic way.   Any noise control strategy will deal with three different areas: the sources, the transmission path and the receiving space.   First it will be necessary to quantify the sources, identify the path by which the source energy travels to the cabin and obtain an understanding of the mechanisms involved.   Secondly it is necessary to develop new and improve technologies leading to substantial noise reductions and to validate the technological advances by using either flight demonstrator or proof-of-concept laboratory experiments.   Finally as part of the overall strategy to reduce noise, it is important to develop a noise prediction capability. This will enable initial helicopter design to be optimized for minimum noise and will also allow the assessment of noise reduction requirements at an early design stage."

In more detail, the principal goals are to improve the precision and coverage of edifice deformation studies in time and space, to develop and improve the quality and quantity of methods, hardware and experience of automated acquisition and management of data, to detect the spatial movement of magma in the upper few kilometers of the upper south flank, and to study the relevance of pre-existing dikes.

A range of polymer classes and device manufacturing approaches have been examined. From this work, plasma coating with functionalised hyaluronic acid polymers has emerged as the system of choice for the fabrication of improved stents for urological applications. A novel ureteric stent has been designed, prototypes manufactured and a patent application filed. A consortium if forming and an exploitation plan is evolving on the basis of these successes. Polymeric materials are widely used as implants in the treatment of human disease. Two major problems associated with urological implants are the development of encrustations and urinary tract infections. These frequently lead to costly extended or repeated hospitalisation. A further need in urology, as in other clinical areas, is for long-term indwelling devices. Here, the problems rising from such lack of biocompatibility are exacerbated. The principal aim of the proposed programme is to design, synthesise, develop and test a range of novel polymeric materials with enhanced biocompatibility, initially for urological use.  Further aims are:  i) to improve understanding, by systematic investigation, of struture-property relationships leading to the establishment of design criteria for polymeric materials used in a particular medical application;  ii) to provide, through the systematic assembly and interpretation of data, a basis for the development of standards.  Emphasis will be placed on an integrated and extensive characterisation regime, encompassing physical, mechanical and surface properties and biological testing in vitro and in vivo. The most promising materials will be used to fabricate prototype devices (tubing, catheters, stents) which, following further, similar characterisation will undergo clinical tests.
100|grant.3703213|AER20049; 5494; EUROSHOCK|European Shock Control Investigation|European Shock Control Investigation|The primary objective of the present research program is the improvement of the performance of transonic transport aircraft by applying shock boundary layer interaction control. This means specifically to minimize the drag due to the presence of a shock, to prevent shock-induced separation and to alleviate or postpone the occurrence of buffet. A thorough investigation of passive shock boundary layer interaction control was performed with the following results:   - The basic experiments have identified the mechanism of control and shown that due to control the single shock is replaced either by a theta-shock or an almost continuous (isentropic) pressure rise which results in a substantial reduction in wave drag; however, the combined blowing - suction (secondary flow) effect and the hole roughness cause an increase in viscous drag which, in determining total drag, will oppose the reduction in wave drag. Furthermore, new control laws have been derived and general deficiencies pointed out.   - Computer codes were successfully extended to treat airfoil flow with control. Corresponding computations predicted for the laminar-type airfoils a considerable reduction in wave drag but also an increase in total drag due to control. The computed boundary layer data clearly showed an increase in momentum thickness over the control region, amplified by the adverse pressure gradients over the rear part of the airfoils, generating viscous drag which overcompensates the reduction in wave drag. The unsteady computations showed a strong damping of the shock oscillations.   - The airfoil tests showed for the laminar airfoils a reduction in wave drag and an increase in total drag in agreement with the computations and for the reasons outlined above. For the turbulent airfoil a marginal reduction in total drag was achieved possibly due to the presence of a thicker boundary layer which seems to be less susceptible to the disturbances in the control region. The results also indicated an improvement of the buffet boundary due to control.   Concerning drag it may now be concluded that passive control can be ruled out as an effective means of reducing drag of laminar wings; even for a turbulent wing, the sensitivity of the effectiveness of passive control to changes in flow parameters makes this control device impracticable, especially since benefits in drag reduction are rather marginal. Nevertheless, there may be applications where drag reduction is not the main driver and passive control may still be of use, for instance, for supersonic intakes, where the objective is to avoid shock induced separation, and, of course, for transonic aircraft where the performance is limited by buffet considerations rather than drag. Finally, since passive control does not seem a viable method for reducing drag, other active or hybrid control techniques must be considered. In order to achieve this we must:   - improve our knowledge of the physics of the control mechanisms and establish physical models and realistic boundary conditions,  - study relevant influence parameters (eg shock strength, hole inclination, etc).  - extend prediction methods to account for SBLIC employing these physical models and boundary conditions,  - carry out tests on realistic (airfoil) configurations up to flight Reynolds numbers to validate these computational methods and  - assess the efficiency of the SBLIC concept by experiment and computation.   In this way, we will provide the tools needed to design wings with SBLIC and, at the same time, demonstrate its potential in improving wing design and off-design performance. Note that the present effort will initially concentrate on the investigation of passive control which seems to provide the best overall efficiency since no additional power input is required.

The objectives are to study experimentally at pilot scale the concept of firing combustion plant with oxygen and recycled flue gas with regard to flame stability, gaseous emissions, heat transfer, fly ash properties, deposition and sulphur build-up and to undertake techno-economic assessment of processes to remove CO2 from flue gas based upon the findings of the experimental study.   Two process schemes were developed for flue gas treatment. One involved the recovery of pure CO2, the  second was a minimum treatment scheme. On technical, environmental and economic grounds the process which  used low purity oxygen and has minimum flue gas treatment was the best option. However, although this process  eliminated CO2 emissions completely, it reduced the efficiency by 8.5%, increased the total capital cost by 50%,  increased specific investment by 90% and increased the break-even electricity selling price by 55% compared  with a standard air-fired power plant. The elimination of nitrogen from combustion processes by firing with oxygen and recycled flue gas results in a substantial reduction in the downstream processing required to subsequently remove the carbon dioxide produced. The project aims to provide experimental data with regard to the combustion process, gaseous emissions, ash properties, ash deposition and heat transfer so as to allow better technical assessment of retrofittable processes for the removal of carbon dioxide from the flue gas of coalfired furnaces.   The following tasks will be undertaken during the course of the project:  1. Modify the 150 kW Clean Coal Combustion Test Facility of Babcock Energy Limited to burn pulverized coal in an oxygen/recycled flue gas environment.  2. Undertake testing on the 150 kW facility under varying process conditions to establish the effects of flue gas recycle relative to conventional combustion.  3. Analyse the experimental data and assess its significance on equipment design.  4. Investigate the potential of sulphur build-up and problems that might be associated with this.  5. Undertake a techno-economic assessment of overall processes in the light of the new experimental data.  6.

This project constitutes the continuation of the research performed by the partners during the last 6 years in the field of hazardous gas mitigation by water curtains. This work has led to a model of the hydrodynamic, thermal and physico-chemical actions of a single spray on a gas cloud. This model has been validated by producting experimental data. This project will extend this successful model to the modelling of a complete spray curtain regarded as an inhibitor and a dispersor of toxic gaseous substances. Validation by wind tunnel experiments will be achieved. For the first time, definite conclusions will be drawn about the total performance that can be expected from this promising mitigation device.  The major steps of this proposed research are the following :  * Enhancement of the fluid curtain efficacy requires a strategy for the selection of appropriate chemical additives. An experimental determination of the thermodynamics and kinetics data for different gas-liquid binaries. In relation with the absorption of the hazardous substances will be undertaken (CO2, Cl2, NOx...);  * To maximize the liquid flow rate per unit length of a fluid curcain and thus expect an increase forges entrainment one makes the sprays overlap;  * A real situation, the spray curtain operates generally in windy conditions. Its solubility and dispersal performance can be hindered by the wind strenght to such an extent that is becomes important to identify the limits of curtain applicability.  The experimental techniques developed by VKI and ITC-Lyon for the hydrodynamics and mass transfer analysis of single spray will be used for the wind tunnel study of the complete fluid curtain.  The outcome of this proposed research will consist in an engineering computer code conceived to provide guidance for the design of fluid curtains and for the evaluation of this mitigation performance.

Both fish have a high market value which may be further increased by elevation of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) levels in their tissues, resulting from increased dietary levels. Also increasing their nutritional and commercial value as healthy food for human consumption, elevated tissue levels of PUFA and vitamin E may increase the resistance of fish to the stressful conditions encountered in intensive aquaculture.   This project examines the physiological and behavioural responses of fish under the conditions prevailing in intensive aquaculture and during handling and transport to identify sources of stress, stress reactions and their possible modulation by dietary manipulation.

In the preliminary research program, thermosetting and thermoplastic PVA binder were chosen to hold together the roving fibre before putting the whole preform in the mould. The latter one seemed more attractive for more easy handling.  A software program was specifically designed and implemented in Fortran to recollect data from the structural analysis of the composite: it reads the results, verifies that none of the stresses would be greater than the admissible ones, and in such cases indicates where further fibre reinforcements must be placed.  A survey on the objective and on the possible exploitation of the machine, joined with the earlier results of this research, helped to design the prototype of the FPS, which was successfully developed and built.  The production of the earlier preforms has already been started, and the physical and mechanical characterisation of the new preforms is currently running. The reference product for these tests is the roof panel for Iveco trucks currently manufactured at Sistema Compositi.  Physical test evidenced similar properties for both preforms, with a little lesser permeability of the new preform. This result could lead to a shorter injection time, but tests performed at the industrial RTM plant at Sistema Compositi no longer support that theses. Composites manufactured with the new preforms show similar mechanical properties at any test. This project presents a new automated preforming manufacture system, called Flexible Preforming System (FPS), enabling production of complex three-dimensional preforms using several glassfiber reinforcements.  Compared to present preforming systems FPS permits freedom of design, maximized mechanical properties and repeatable/consistent quality of the preformed composites.  In order to manufacture the preforms as fast as possible, the project will provide a novel mathematical model to calculate the optimum path of the FPS' feed head, needed to deposit continuous glassfiber on every assigned performing surface, and to calculate the preforming process parameters needed to execute the path.  The major research tasks of the project are:  1. Definition of continuous fiber FPS and associated range of fundamental process parameters.  2.

On the one hand efficient laboratory cells will be made, using micro-electronic technologies to assess the limit of intrinsic possibilities. On the other hand there will be a trade-off with cost using industrially oriented technology for certain steps.    High efficiency and low cost solar cell modules are the 2 important requirements for the breakthrough of photovoltaics. Of course, efficiency also indirectly contributes to the overall system cost, because of the balance-of-system costs (BOS). The higher the BOS costs, the more important the role of efficiency becomes. The efficiency and cost of solar cell modules are sometimes conflicting parameters, because cheaper techniques of fabrication usually lead to lower efficiency.  The project goals are :  * a best (lab) efficiency of 15.5-16% on 10x10 cm  * an ""industrial efficiency"" of app. 15% on 10x10 cm  * The direct goal cost is < 1.5 ECU/Wp  A lot of attention will also be paid to the quality of the ingot material. Studies will be done to understand the difference in gettering mechanism on the different multicrystalline materials under study. In other words: the relation between structural, compositional and electrical properties of the substrate material and in function of the production step history will be clarified further."

These results have been reached by using innovative techniques for material processing and modification based on Reactive extrusion (REX) and Solid State Poly-Addition (SSPA). These procedures permitted to modify recycled PET resins reaching targeted melt strength, molecular weight and rheology properties. These specific properties were required to develop new modified materials such as chopped glass fibres reinforced and high melt elasticity resins (e.g. foamable PET or high speed spinnable POY fibres). The new modified materials recovered from the recycled resources were utilised in the preparation of fabricated parts such as Thermoplastic composites, Foamed sheets, POY Fibres for Textile industry and RTM Sandwich Panels. The Extruded glass reinforced PET sheets with 30 to 40% reached elastic moduli ranging between 10 to 12 GPa and the impact strength of 140 J/m (Izod). The Injected PET samples with a glass fibre content of 30% (in weight) achieved a final elasticity modulus of about 10 GPa. The impact strength was 44 KJ/m{2} (Charpy). The Polypropylene RTS (Reinforced Thermoplastic Sheets) and injected samples with a glass fibre mat and chopped fibres reached about 5 GPa.. A new machinery was specifically designed, set-up and tested for continuously extrude PET foams of constant properties and different apparent densities around 100 kg/m{3}, closed and uniform cellular structure. The technology and chemical modification defined in this project have been applied by M&G to the recycled polymer producing resins that can be foamed to the desired density and appropriate mechanical properties. The resulting foams presented a closed cellular structure and higher thermal stability (up to 220°C) and flexural and compression strengths (4 MPa and 2 MPa, respectively) compared to those of the conventional foams (i.e. max. Working temperature of 80-100°C and strengths even 3/4 times lower). One of the most important results of the present project could be referred to the production of unsaturated polyester Resin Transfer Moulded (RTM) sandwich panels with the mentioned foamed core. This achievement has been completed in a very satisfactory manner. The resulting sandwich panels presented a strongly improved shear resistance due to the improved adhesion between the foam and the external composite skin and to the higher mechanical strength of the foam itself. Fibres have been produced according to a POY standard process and at speeds up to 5000 m/min. The mechanical properties of the POY material thus generated give tenacity and elongation values at break of about 2.5 cN/dtex and 70%, respectively. Dyeing properties and dye up-takes are comparable or even higher than for standard PET. Second recycling of such products produced materials and samples of mechanical characteristics comparable with those of the starting first recycled materials. Solid State PolyAddition reactions following a reactive extrusion mixing stage will be used to modify polymeric matrices derived from recycled materials.  Recycled materials available in various E.E.C. countries will be collected, analysed and selected to fit the requirements as raw materials for fabricated products for structural and esthetic performance.  The above said modified matrices will be used:  - to make reactive low viscosity polymer melts to impregnate glass mats and fillers for reinforced thermoplastics; to be upgraded for good mechanical properties in the mould of afterwards;  - to make high melt viscosity for foams to be used as core for TRM parts;  - to increase the molecular weight to be used in POY production and high performance fibres.  An especially designed extruder prototype will be built to perform the reactive extrusion mixing with recycled materials and the materials thus obtained will be characterised physically and mechanically and experimental parts will be produced. The further recycling of parts will be also investigated.

One of the major problems to be overcome is the lack of a generic system support. Two basic technologies are required to make such support feasible : an appropriate transport service and a generic multimedia teleservice to provide a framework for application development. To approach the issues outlined above, the Action defined three objectives : Specification of the Communication Related Service Requirements necessary to allow the distribution of those advanced multimedia applications which have been developed in national and other pan-European projects (and are mainly stand-alone). Definition of protocols and mechanisms required to provide a suitable transport service to these applications to allow them to be used effectively for group communications. Assessment of suitable networks, service elements and Quality of Service (QoS) for the implementation of the Communication Related Service Requirements of these multimedia applications. Enhancement of the service specification of existing standard reference models, taking into account user requirements and feedback from practical implementations and trials.  Current status Following the success of the first international workshop entitled ""Multimedia Transport and Teleservices"" in November 1994, the Action has organised further workshops each year in November. The event was hosted in 1995 by the Technical University of Denmark in Copenhagen, with the 1996 workshop organised by Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya in Barcelona. The Action has also co-operated with ACTS projects to for the ECMAST 96 conference. Working group activities WG 1 multimedia teleservices The WG 1 initially set itself the ambitious objective of defining and specifying generic components of the Multimedia Teleservice model. This was to be done by analysing a number of multimedia communications applications and examining the requirements of various business sectors. However the same objectives were subsequently tackled also by other and more influential groups, such as the MMCF (Multimedia Communications Forum) and especially DAVIC (Digital Audio Video Council), in which most of the members of this WG were participating.  The work of this WG has been focused, under a new chairman - Prof. Wolfgang Effelsberg, to concentrate on a number of specific teleservices (such as Teleteaching, Video-on-demand) and examine them in more detail. The first of these is Teleteaching, and the main objective is to gather information from all members on tools available, and experiences and to develop a model of the teleservice.  To gain practical experience in the use of multicast services for group communications a number of multimedia seminars, which will be transmitted over the Internet, are being organised. These COST 237 Euroseminars will be transmitted from the site of one of the members of the working group and will be available to all other members with the appropriate facilities. WG 2 transport service issues The work of WG2 was based on a recognition of the key role played by the transport service in matching the new requirements of co-operative multimedia applications to the increasingly sophisticated support offered by the emerging network technologies. This group built on the results already achieved in RACE projects and after two years of activity was successful in its aims, having defined a multimedia transport service incorporating both quality of service and multipeer connectivity. During this period the working group made substantial contributions to the ISO SC6 in the area of the QoS model of the Group Communication Management and of the Multipeer Taxonomy. From the beginning of WG2 activities, the creation of a WG was envisaged to consider the transport provider issues as soon as the transport service has been completely specified. This occurred in November 1995 when the completion of the tasks of WG 2 was recognised. The results of WG needed to be enhanced by the definition of the required protocols and mechanisms able to provide the transport service identified during the first two years. Protocols have achieved a significant role in the definition of standards and are needed for the experimental validation of the key concepts proposed in the multimedia transport service. WG 3 communications support for multimedia applications WG 3 was built on the work of WG 2 and its objective has been to consider the protocols and mechanisms necessary to underpin the enhanced transport service. Its concern will thus be the detailed mapping of the transport service onto network technologies (primarily ATM and Internets) and end-systems. The group will focus on developing an understanding of the protocols required for multicasting, resource management, media-scaling and distributed control (signalling) in a heterogeneous network and end-system environment.  Another important area of study will be the influence of application characteristics, such as media encoding (e.g. MPEG) on communications protocol design, as well as application oriented design. Moreover, the work on billing and pricing of network services will be taken into account as an influencing factor in multimedia protocol design. The above-mentioned activities have been identified as a major research task within the COST 237 participants and significant work has been started to put these developments in a common architecture. WG 4 security and applications WG 4 has its origins in the activities of COST 237 members involved in DAVIC and in WG 1. The group was established in November 1995 to examine the security aspects associated with the production and the delivery of multimedia services. Among the security services considered are Trusted Third Parties, which will act as a secure point of authorisation and authentication between the different multimedia service and content providers and the subscribers to services such as Video-on-demand and Pay-per-View. Work planned The WG investigating Multimedia Teleservices is examining the ""teleteaching"" teleservice. A number of ""COST 237 Euroseminars"" are being organised which will allow for distribution of colloquia using the Mbone. A comprehensive list of multimedia applications and tools relevant for teleteaching is being compiled and will be published on a Web server. The ""Communications Support for Multimedia Applications"" group will continue its work in the mapping of the transport service to the underlying network technologies and end systems. Together with ACTS projects, the Action is involved in the organisation of the ECMAST '97 conference to be held in Milan in May 1997. The successful format of workshops will be continued with a further event planned for November 1997.  All of the working groups will focus their efforts on the final report and outputs of the Action."

100|grant.3719499|V2036; 17003; DYNA|A Dynamic Traffic Model for Real-Time Applications|A Dynamic Traffic Model for Real-Time Applications|The main objectives of the project are:   to develop and implement on the basis of the dynamic transport models developed in DRIVE 1 and elsewhere, practical dynamic traffic model system that can be used as an on-line decision support tool by traffic management; and  to apply and evaluate the model in a pilot project in an interurban motorway network, and to evaluate its performance.  Technical Approach   Within DRIVE II, traffic forecasts have been recognised as a core issue in the area of interurban traffic management. DYNA aims to provide a practical model system to provide forecasts of traffic flows and travel times for interurban motorway networks. These forecasts are to be produced in real-time, for points in time up to 60 minutes ahead.   The DYNA system uses a combination of different forecasting models. A system architecture has been specified to define how these models should be integrated into a single forecasting system. The system consists of a prediction module, offers room for a control module, and contains two interfaces. One of the interfaces allows a Traffic Operator to access the system. Through the other interface the system is fed with measurements. The prediction module itself can be interfaced with a Control module, which is to be developed at a later stage.   The prediction system contains three different models: a model for on-line estimation of time-varying OD matrices (O/D), a time dynamic traffic assignment model (DTA) and a statistical traffic model (STM). The prediction module contains a separate module to merge the forecasts from the STM and the DTA. The STM module works in parallel with the OD and DTA modules; the system output consists of the merged results of the STM and DTA modules. Results from these modules will be merged where their prediction horizons overlap.   OD-estimation: Building on the results and recommendations of the DRIVE-1 ODIN project a sequential OD-estimation method was selected for use in the DYNA model. This approach combines a-priori information about OD patterns with the most recently observed traffic volumes on the entries and exits of the motorway network to produce up-to-date estimates of the time varying OD pattern. For application in a forecasting environment the estimated OD matrix needs to be extrapolated ahead in time to produce an expected near-future OD matrix. Although the final methodology to do this had not yet been established, an approach for OD-prediction has been developed.   Dynamic traffic assignment: The algorithm selected for use in DYNA was chosen following a review of available methods. The assignment works closely together with the OD estimation model, in order to guarantee consistency in operation. The assignment method uses a continuous packet approach, in combination with probabillstic path choice. It is anticipated that the dynamic assignment will have a prediction horizon of 15-60 minutes.   Statistical traffic model: Much more frequent forecasts will be generated by the statistical traffic model. It is hoped that this model will be able to operate at a 1 minute cycle, refreshing its forecasts every time that new measurement information becomes available. The methodology selected for the DYNA system is based upon original research and an expensive literature review. The proposed method uses a Kalman filter to continuously produce updated estimates of the state-space model and generate forecasts. It is suitable for use in real-time. The choice of its transition equations draws partly on the work done in DRIVE I project 'Christiane'. It is anticipated that the statistical traffic model will have a prediction horizon of 1 to 30 minutes.   Evaluation: pilot application   The real-time model system will be applied and tested on a motorway network in a pilot area round Rotterdam comprising some 200 kilometres of highway. The model will be fed with traffic speed and flow information measured using loop detectors from the Rijkswaterstaat monitoring system for the Dutch motorway network. The average inter-detector spacing will vary from 1 to 5 kilometres. Measurements from these detectors will be concentrated, in a control centre in real-time. The model system will first be calibrated, and then be applied to obtain short term prediction of speeds and flows for periods of 1 to 30 or 60 minutes ahead. This information, if sufficiently reliable, will be used, after completion of the project, to provide drivers with information about expected congestion and possible delays.   The testing schedule is as follows: first off-line tests will be performed involving the use of synthetic and recorded loop information to simulate on-line conditions; after this the models will be tested in an on-line setting. The results of the model predictions can be compared against actual realisations (speed and flows). The monitoring system (loops and processors) is expected to be operational in the first half of 1994.   Further Technical Specification   For the components of the proposed model system further technical documentation is available from the members of the Consortium specifying in more detail the technical approaches that are planned.   Key Issues   Specifically the DYNA project has set out to do the following:   to design and specify a model system to provide the required very short term interurban network traffic forecasts in real-time.  to provide an efficient implementation of the model system suitable for testing,  to test the model system using simulated data, and  to apply the model system using real data in a pilot project, and to evaluate its performance.   Expected Impact   DYNA will provide forecasts of traffic flows and travel times for inter-urban motorway networks in real-time, with a prediction horizon of 1- 30 (or 60) minutes.   Since such forecasts form an essential part of any on-line traffic management system, the impact of the project will be in providing it's users with a practical decision support tool for traffic management.

Best thermal shock resistance and protectiveness to oxidation and gas corrosion was achieved with Mullite and Zirconium silicate coatings which have only a low thermal expansion mismatch with the composite.  For protection against cast iron a capping layer of Alumina or Zirconia is needed. The protectiveness of the coating is related to its thickness, adhesion, porosity and susceptibility to cracking.  Trial components have been manufactured for testing in a radiant tube furnace and a cast iron pouring chute. Two Ring Segments in the Radiant Tube Furnace have survived 1200 at > 1200 C without serious degradation. The performance of coated CMCs in the cast iron pouring tests is superior to that of uncoated materials, a real Trapezoidal Plate has been tested during 15 days on a Production line, surviving 4160 cycles.
100|grant.3720793|EU658; 33890; CEFIR|European high temperature fibres|European high temperature fibres|The recent development in Europe of fibre-reinforced ceramic materials based on Japanese reinforcements has demonstrated the feasibility of extending the temperature range provided by the high temperature materials currently used. The project will aim at providing European sources of high temperature filaments capable of operating air.  Three types of fibre have been identified:   a) a low cost fibre of less than 20 fm diam. for application to 1000 deg. C  b) a high performance fibre of less than 20 fm diam. for application to 1300 deg. C  c) a high performance fibre, for application to 1500 deg. C in air   The first two fibre types may fall into the same category. Precursor fibres which are pyrolysed to give small diameter (20 fm) polycrystalline or amorphous ceramic fibres represent the production route which provides the Japanese fibres at present used. It is proposed that this route should be explored for the production of the fibre types a and b above, but with the target to achieve fibres of higher E-modulus and strength. The requirements of the fibre type c may be achieved by continuous single crystal filaments with diameters of less than 50 fm. The feasibility of these materials and appropriate production routes should be investigated.   Definition Phase:  The Definition Phase will detail precisely the aim of the Research, Development and Exploitation Phase. To do this two working parties will established consisting of all the industrial partners and some academic specialists and co-ordinated by two firms having particular interest in one or more of the fibre types. These working parties will use their respective experiences with the currently available composites together with a scientific analysis of the high temperature potential of materials to define the characteristics required of the three types of fibre. The members of these working parties will also co-operate in a study of the market potential of these fibre types.   Based on this knowledge research teams will be chosen and defined to develop and characterise the required filaments and production routes.   The two working parties will combine to explore funding sources with the European countries involved.   At present a number of research teams have been identified in Europe who are capable of developing high temperature filaments either by the conversion of precursor fibres or by growing single crystal filaments. A number of large industrial users representing advanced European technology for whom the development of European sources of high temperature reinforcements is a strategic necessity, have come together to support this project. An important goal of the Definition Phase will be the identification and involvement of a firm or firms capable of manufacturing precursor fibres and converting them into ceramic filaments. If such a firm is not associated with the project to produce ceramic fibres from precursors, it will be deemed to fail and will not continue. In this event, the part of the project related to single crystal filaments for application above 1300 deg. C will require a new decision to be taken.

New approaches were developed and applied to investigations on the structures of melanins by nondestructive methods. This led to the identification of novel structural elements and a revised mechanism of biosynthesis. Furthermore, new insights into the mechanisms of action of important neurotoxins were gained.   The work is of particular significance for future investigations on the molecular aspects of Parkinson's disease (PD) in connection with the role of neuromelanin (NM). PD is a neurological disorder affecting primarily the elderly. It is estimated that in Europe approximately 20 to 30 out of 1000 of those over the age of 60 will develop the symptoms of Parkinsonism. In coming years, PD will probably even become more frequent because of the general increase of human life span. Thus, Parkinsonism is an increasing public health problem, and the enormous social and economical impact of PD is quite obvious.

The INTREPID project is linked to ROCKI (project 5376). The planned recognition system must cope with a mixture of texts, line graphics, headings and grey-scale images, and with a variety of character sizes, styles and print qualities. Advanced distributed computer hardware will be used so that the increased requirements of new recognition algorithms and strategies can be satisfied.  INTREPID is aiming to:   - Develop new advanced preprocessing and character classification strategies and their implementation, together with existing approaches, in order to process poor-quality documents more successfully.  - Improve reading results by advanced post-processing functions incorporating document layout analysis and linguistic-based approaches. The results of the ROCKI project on decomposing documents into different regions of interest will be taken into account.  - Employ algorithmic procedure and recognition strategies, which can be particularly effective when supported by an appropriate hardware/software architecture. In order to show this, suitable algorithms will be chosen, implemented, tested and modified on a distributed parallel hardware architecture.  - Demonstrate the results in suitable development environments (PC, workstation or dedicated hardware) and in an application specifically developed for the automatic classification of office documents.   The main workpackages can be grouped into four categories:   From Preprocessing to Postprocessing   - working out strategies, procedures and algorithms in the field of preprocessing andclassification, suitable for supporting the recognition of poor-quality office documents  - developing structural algorithms for text recognition and line graphic analysis  - analysing the format and layout of office documents.   Linguistic Contextual Postprocessing   - investigating basic algorithms for lexical, grammatical and semantic analysers  - their application to a number of European languages (English, Italian, Spanish).   Hardware and Software Architecture Definition and Prototype Implementation   - defining a distributed parallel computer architecture, based on state-of-the-art technology, best suited for the recognition procedures on an appropriate prototype hardware platform.

The objective is to identify the most promising technologies and to discover areas where further research and development would be  valuable. Macroeconomic factors concerning social and environmental aspects will also be included.  The project will be based in part on further development of a computer model for mass balances, energy balances and economics of processes for synthesising liquid fuels. This will be reinforced with data from the new projects in the Energy from Biomass subprogramme so that more precise models and cost  estimates can be produced for each of the liquid production, upgrading and utilisation processes. This will permit consistent comparisons to be made of alternative processes as well as to identify areas of greatest technical uncertainty to assist in ongoing project appraisal and orientation. This will be supported by detailed flow sheets, mass and energy balances, and cost estimates for a limited number of specific processes supported by John Brown and Constructor.   The economic analysis will be adapted by ECOTEC to take account of the full range of social, political and environmental cost benefits that can be attributed to the development of these technologies in order to provide a sounder basis for decision making. These aspects are particularly important the context of the LEBEN projects that are being considered. The outputs of the project will be a technical economic model of the processes involved in the production of liquid fuels from biomass, a technical economic assessment of the range of pyrolysis and upgrading routes for the production of liquid fuels, a thorough assessment of the total impact of these technologies projects such as LEBEN and similar activities in developing countries and recommendations on areas where further research and development would be valuable.

Many laser ultrasound generation, tests were performed on composite and aluminium samples, studying in particular the dependence of the generated signal on the characteristics of the piezoelectric detector and the signal to noise ratio. With reference to laser ultrasound detection, tests were performed by means of time delay, heterodyne and Confocal Fabry Perot interferometers.  The research into eddy current has involved the development of advanced probes for the inspection of composite structures and the development of a multifrequency data acquisition system.  For shearography, holography, speckle camera and thermography, the result has been the improvement of loading devices, acquisition systems and analysis software as well as the set up of inspection procedures. To accomplish this the following tasks have to be achieved :  - development of non-contract inspection methods  - evaluation of existing methods currently used in laboratory environment  - evaluation and comparison of different techniques.

The specific aims of the project include: a scientific basis for rheological modelling and computer aided design/computer aided manufacture (CAD/CAM) analysis of the processing of liquid crystalline polymers (LCP); guidelines to predict the effect of the flow history on the resulting microstructure.  The project provides a scientific basis for dealing with processing problems of LCPs such as: development of materials, design of moulds, selection and optimisation of injection moulding. The results constitute the basic elements of a computer aided design/computer aided manufacture programme, which could be developed with the available results.  The project has generated quite complete sets of rheological data, including transient behaviour, for 2 LCPs. This provides a basis for understanding the flow behaviour of such materials and the underlying flow induced structure. These aspects have been conidered in detail in the subsequent parts of the project. For the first time systematic data on velocity profiles in LCPs have been obtained (1-dimensional and 2-dimensional flows). This indicates how the rheological data can be used to simulate flows. Deviations from predictions have been found for which explanations are suggested. For the analysis of the flow induced structures a device for SALS measurements on flowing systems has been developed. The resulting data, together with other rheooptical measurements, provided the basis for a structural interpretation of the rheological experiments, both for steady shear flow and for transients. By using rod like molecular theory, the behaviour of LCPs has been modelled in the various flow regimes, from tumbling at relatively low shear rates up to flow aligning behaviour at high ones. Based on both experiments and theory a consistent description of the complex dynamics of these materials has emerged. It has been used to develop a rheological model that was demonstrated to describe the detailed experimental results quite well, at least at the relevant high shear rates. The project should provide a scientific basis for dealing with processing problems of LCPs such as: development of materials, design of moulds, selection and optimisation of injection moulding. These constitute the basic elements of a CAD/CAM programme, which could be developed in a subsequent Type 1 project.
100|grant.3713270|AERO0008; 17189; CAPRI|Civil aircraft protection against ice|Civil aircraft protection against ice|The ice physics investigations have resulted in a very much better understanding of the physical properties of ice which will ultimately greatly assist the development of new ice protection and detection systems. The pilot programme has also enabled specialised techniques and facilities to be developed which will provide a sound basis for further developments in the knowledge of ice physics.   The study of a section of an accretion can reveal some of the history behind the formation of the ice. The trajectory of the iced up structure through the air, the temperature and the icing conditions and the way these vary, all leave recognisable features in the microstructure of the ice. These features are permanent enough to enable practical recovery, storage and transportation of the ice, providing suitable conditions are maintained.   The adhesion of ice to different materials varies significantly. The performance of a mechanical de-icer is influenced by the degree of ice adhesion, so the careful selection of surface material for de-icers will enhance their effectiveness.   The presence of ice may be detected by dielectric means, both at very low frequencies and in the microwave domain. The sensitivity of the techniques suggests potential to detect low levels of airfoil contamination, and more localised thicker accretions.   The use of thermal imaging techniques for ice surface temperature measurement is very practical. Lightweight equipment has the sensitivity and flexibility to provide invaluable data for heat transfer studies to improve ice accretion modelling approximations, and to help relate this to the observed structure and properties of ice.   A basis exists for the complete design of an impulsive de-icing system with a high probability of good performance without recourse to a lengthy iterative design and testing. Considerable potential exists to engineer the structures and materials involved in electro-impulsive de-icers to obtain better performance than has been achieved to date. CAPRI is a pilot programme comprising a number of tasks which address both fundamental and technical aspects of aircraft ice protection.   During the initial phases of the programme, experimental and theoretical work on the mechanics and physics of ice and water will be undertaken in order to provide an improved understanding of the basics and to assess the potential of various concepts. These include microwave heating, advanced electrical, mechanical and electromechanical, ice phobic and fluid based systems. To complement this work an assessment of the ice protection requirements of aircraft of advanced aerodynamic performance will be made.   Following the preliminary fundamental phase of the investigation 2 potential systems will be selected for development and testing. The data available at this stage of the work will ensure that the design of the 2 systems can proceed without an extended period of development.   The 2 trial systems will be tested in an icing tunnel and their performance examined critically in the light of the theoretical and fundamental aspects involved. The consortium will, at this stage, have a consolidated understanding of the basic considerations and will be in a strong position to make further developments beyond the scope of the pilot programme.

For example it will study the recovery of carbon dioxide from:   conventional coal fired plant using a scrubber system,  conventional coal fired plant with oxygen enriched air feed,  combined cycle coal combustion plants, where fluidised bed gasification and combustion and gas turbines are used.   This study will include an appraisal of the options available for the safe disposal of the liquid carbon dioxide so produced.    2) The Eclipse package will be modified so that it can used to predict the performance of planned or existing chemical process plant, particularly oil refineries, under conditions of changing feedstock or product slate. These types of changes could be envisaged if, for example, there were a change from oil based feedstock to coal based feedstock.   This work involves changing the program so that the critical operating parameters of existing process plant can be measured and then used to predict how this plant would operate under different conditions and extending the chemical compounds database to include oil fractions and ensuring that the methods used to predict their properties are the ones recommended by API.

This research should lead to improved efficiency and a lower emission of particulates (e.g. soot), NOx and CO2.  A model experiment is presented as a bridge case between fundamental research and studies on practical combustion systems. The evolution of one diesel spray in high temperature (900 K), high pressure (4 MPa), nearly quiescent (cross flow velocity of 1 m/s), oxidative (air) environment is characterized for 2 injection conditions that are of interest in light duty diesel engines (1.6 and 6 mg/stroke/hole). Laser light scattering and emission imaging have been used for this purpose together with chemical analysis of material sampled with a fast sampling valve, at 35 mm from the nozzle. The structures of the combustion processes for the 2 injection conditions show similar features. The comparison of the diesel combustion structure presented in with those reported in the literature, relative to injections of much higher fuel quantity, suggests that both experimental conditions define prototypic classes fo diesel-like processes, which should be considered as reference models in the analysis of apparatus dependent combustion processes in real diesel engines.  Absorption, fluorescence and scattering measurements were carried out in rich premixed ethylene oxygen flames. Soot and condensed hydrocarbon species concentrations were measured by direct sampling and chemical analysis in the carbon oxygen range from 0.65 to 0.75 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) accounts for no more than 20% of the condensed hydrocarbon species. The early formation in the flames of structures with typical size around 2nm (2500 amu), which do not absorb and fluoresce in the visible, was followed by means of ultraviolet scattering and absorption measurements. These transparent particles were considered to be soot precursors on the basis of their decreasing concentration profile in correspondence of soot inception, as evaluated by both optical and chemical measurements. The soot inception process is characterized by the progressive aromatization of the transparent particles as shown by the progressive shift toward the visible of absorption and fluorescence. The internal rearrangement of a partially aromatic polymeric structure, more than a progressive formation of very large PAH structures, is proposed as a mechanism for soot inception. Five European car manufacturers (members of the Joint Research Committee) collaborate in this project on Diesel engines. Diesel engines are the most efficient engines for transportation, but future regulations for emission of pollutants such as particulates (e.g. soot) and NOx are likely to be so severe that this objective can only be achieved with a very high technical effort. The  IDEA Project was therefore set up to explore new ways to reduce pollution and increase efficiency. The work in this project is based on previous work carried out under EC contracts (EN3E-049-UK, EN3E-102-D, EN3E-124-F) which resulted in three three-dimensional computer codes of which two are relevant for Diesel engines: the SPEED-SPRAY and the SPEED codes.   Work in the IDEA programme will be carried out in two areas: computer simulation of Diesel engines and basic R&D on combustion processes in Diesel engines. The programme has been divided into 5 sub-programmes: theoretical work on computer code development and experimental work on the topics: fuel spray, auto ignition, flame propagation, and pollutant formation.   The SPEED and SPEED-SPRAY code will be further developed and integrated in a code for computation of three-dimensional Diesel combustion processes including models for fuel spray, auto-ignition flame propagation and pollutant formation. Extensive experimental work will be carried out by the participating laboratories on spray behaviour, auto-ignition, flame propagation and pollutant formation. This work should come up with methods to reduce pollutant formation. The experimental data obtained will also be used to validate the three-dimensional computer code for Diesel engine combustion. The use of this  simulation model will make an important contribution to the design of more efficient Diesel engines with a strongly reduced pollution. It will also enable European car industry to reduce time and cost in developing new engines and to maintain its leadership in world Diesel technology.

As the participants intend to increase con tacts with their colleagues to solve the numerous problems that have arisen in this fundamental area of computer science, this Working Group was dedicated to organising workshops and joint seminars to provide a framework for participants to come together and share ideas, methods and results. A collection of researchers collaborated on problems of mutual interest in algebraic and syntactic methods in computer science. This included combinatorics on words and theory of codes, formal language and grammar theory, theory of automata, process algebras and infinite behaviours of parallel programs and systems.  Numerous bilateral exchanges have been supported by the algebraic and syntactic methods in computer science (ASMICS) project; 5 specialized workshops and 2 general ASMICS meetings have been organized. Some new themes closely related to automata theory have been emphasized such as dynamical systems, temporal logic, tiling and geometrical problems, and synchronization. APPROACH AND METHODS  The research that can be undertaken in the field of algebraic and syntactic methods in computer science can be grouped under four headings:  -combinatorics on words and theory of codes  -formal language and grammar theory to define sets of words, sets of trees, sets of images  -theory of automata corresponding to given languages  -process algebras and infinite behaviours of parallel programs and systems.  PROGRESS AND RESULTS - STATUS OF OCTOBER 1991  Numerous bilateral exchanges have been supported by ASMICS; five specialised workshops and two general ASMICS meetings have already been organised (see below), and several others are planned.  A steady stream of papers have been written by ASMICS members. Some new themes closely related to automata theory have been emphasised such as dynamical systems, temporal logic, tiling and geometrical problems, synchronisation.  POTENTIAL  In each of the four main topics mentioned above, the influence of ASMICS on scientific research has been quite decisive. For the future, participants would like to develop this cooperation on a larger scale, possibly including some precise development projects around automata and words.

The objectives of the project can be summarized as follows:  Development of a structural RIM nylon system, using either discrete fibre reinforcement or replaced mat or roving.  Characterization of the mechanical properties of the most promising systems, and the generation of engineering design data.  Detailed study of processing structure-property relationships in these materials with particular emphasis on impact behaviour and fracture toughness and related studies of the interface.  Evaluation of long-term dimensional stability, and fatigue behaviour together with an evaluation of environmental resistance. As a result of this programme an engineering data bank will be made available which would enable the designer to select material for a particular type of loading situation. The results were: development of a structural RIM (SRIM) nylon system using glass mat reinformcement; characterisation ofthe mechanical properties of the most promising systems and the generation of engineering design data; deterioration of the tensile strength of the composites is mainly due to the water induced plasticization effect at the interface between fibres and the matrix and due to destruction of polymer polymer hydrogen bonds. The changes in the strength, thermal behaviour and crystalline and morphological structures in these desiccated samples, particularly in those with higher fibre contents, are related to chemical modifications and physical aspects due to the sorption and desorption.

100|grant.3701253|ST2*0388; 857|MOLECULAR ANALYSIS OF THE RAS-ADENYLATE CYCLASE SYSTEM|MOLECULAR ANALYSIS OF THE RAS-ADENYLATE CYCLASE SYSTEM|A initial genetic approach has allowed the definition of single amino acid residues of the Ras2 protein that are critical for its function. After random mutagenesis of the chromosomal RAS2 gene in ras1 strains, isogenic yeast cells expressing Ras2 proteins with either increased or reduced function have been isolated and characterised. 4 regions of Ras2 have been identified where single amino acid substitutions were capable of deregulating the function of the protein. Theseregions are centred around positions 19, 40, 70 and 82-84. Since the yeast and the human Ras proteins are highly related over the 160 amino terminal amino acids, the positions that have been identified correspond to residues 12, 33, 63 and 75-77 of the human protein.  The wild type and mutated Ras2 proteins have been purified using an Escherichia coli expression system. Moreover, yeast membranes used as a source of either Ras or adenylyl cyclase have allowed the performance of in vitro complementation assays between wild type and mutated forms of both enzymes.  The relevant conclusions of the biochemical analyses can be summarised as follows: The Ras2 protein is capable of stimulating adenylyl cyclase in its guanosine triphosphate (GTP) bound, but not in its guanosine diphosphate (GDP) bound form. Furthermore, the guanosine diphosphate aminophosphate bound form is as effective as the GTP bound form. Therefore, the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity of the protein can be considered as a turnoff mechanism for the conversion of the active to the inactive form of Ras. The replacement of amino acids in the region 12-13 or 59-63 by other residues activates the oncogenic function of the protein in high eukaryotes. This is due to an impaired GTPase activity of the protein, that therefore cannot attain the inactive (GDP bound) state. In yeast cells, the same mutations cause an inability to properly arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The regeneration of the active from the inactive form takes place by a nucleotide exchange reaction, in which the rate limiting step is the dissociation of GDP. Macromolecular effectors like Sdc25 are able to increase the rate of this reaction in vitro, thus catalysing the formation of the active Ras2.GTP complex. The effect of macromolecular effectors on the nucleotide exchange reaction can be mimicked by a single amino acid substitution at position 152 of the Ras2 protein.  The biochemical analysis of Ras mutants, that were initially found as temperature sensitive lethals, has provided important clues to the mechanism of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) activation of Ras. The region centred around position 33 is important for the interaction of Ras with its target, since a single amino acid substitution at this position reduced the ability of Ras to stimulate adenylyl cyclase. The structure of this loop is reorganised upon replacement of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) by GTP. Residues 75-77 are also important for function, since the introduction of other amino acids strongly reduced adenylyl cyclase stimulation by Ras. The replacement of the glycine residue 75 by serine did not modify the affinity of Ras for GDP, but it decreased the affinity for the GTP analogue guanosine diphosphate aminophosphate. Therefore, despite the great thermal mobility of loop L4-L5, the modification of the glycine residue 75 can influence the nucleotide binding site. A possible explanation is that loops L4-L5 are mobile in some directions, but that the 2 loops are relatively rigid in linking nucleotide proximal with distal residues. A further implication of this result is that the binding of macromolecular effectors of Ras to loops L4-L5 could influence the binding of the nucleotide, and vice versa. One important aspect of our future work will be the evaluation of functional properties of mutated Ras proteins harbouring additional single amino acid substitutions in loops L2 and L4-L5.  The function of the elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) from bacteria is modulated by the alternate binding of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) or guanosine diphosphate (GDP) during the elongation cycle. This protein has been the object of intensive biochemical analysis, and the mechanism of action of several antibiotics acting on EF-Tu has been elucidated. A new antibiotic acting specifically on the GTP bound form of EF-Tu has now been identified and molecularly characterised. Moreover, the role of specific amino acids in the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) reaction has been investigated. Hopefully, the similarity between the molecular mechanisms regulating the function of Ras and EF-Tu will facilitate the production of antibiotics acting specifically on the oncogenic forms of Ras.  It has been previously established that the yeast adenylyl cyclase is functionally inactive in the absence of Ras proteins, and the synthesis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) is activated by the presence of the guanosine triphosphate (GTP) bound form of Ras. It has also been found that single amino acid substitutions at position 1651 of the adenylyl cyclase resulted in a detectable activity even in the absence of Ras. This could be explained by a model in which regulatory amino terminal regions of adenylyl cyclase negatively and reversibly regulate a carboxy terminal catalytic domain in the absence of Ras; and amino acid residue 1651 is critical for the interaction between regulatory and catalytic domains. According to the model, the Ras independent activation of catalytic function by single amino acid substitutions at position 1651 could be explained by a reduced interaction between inhibitory and catalytic domains.  This model predicted that some amino acid substitutions at position 1651 could lead to a stronger interaction with regulatory domains, thus resulting in hyperinhibition of catalytic function. This prediction has been confirmed by the finding that the introduction of negatively charged residues at position 1651 could reduce the weak activation of the catalytic domain that follows the overexpression of the adenylyl cyclase in a ras- background. In agreement with the model, the removal of amino terminal domains form the enzyme carrying a negatively charged residue at position 1651 resulted in reactivation of the function of the catalytic domain.  Advantage can be taken of the enzyme carrying a negatively charged residue at position 1651 to select for randomly induced mutations that could reactivate the function of the attenuated adenylyl cyclase. Point mutations have been identified, leading to single amino acid substitutions at positions 1331, 1345, 1348 and 1374, individually capable of reactivating the mutated enzyme. These residues define a new region of adenylyl cyclase that is involved in the negative control of the catalytic domain in the absence of Ras.  A mutated adenylyl cyclase harbouring a single amino acid substitution at position 1374 and a wild type sequence at position 1651 was found to show an impaired response to Ras. Therefore, by searching for amino acid residues that are involved in the negative control ofthe catalytic activity in the absence of active Ras proteins, a residue has also been identified that is important for Ras dependent activation. This suggests that some amino acid residues are critical both for the negative regulation of the catalytic centre in the absence of active Ras and for the Ras dependent regulation.  Genetic techniques have been used to identify genes that have a functional relationship with Ras. 2 genes have been isolated, originally called PR3E and KOM1, that were able to suppress a temperature sensitive RAS function, upon expression on a high copy number plasmid. From the nucleotide sequence the 2 genes appeared to be alleles of TPK3 and SCH9, respectively. These genes have been previously identified as suppressors of a temperature sensitive CDC25 function. The disruption of SCH9 KOM1, that appears to encode a putative protein kinase of 824 amino acids, resulted in a slower growth rate. It has been found that the levels and the activity of the RAS1, RAS2 and adenylyl cyclase gene products in cells growing logarithmically were not significantly affected by the disruption of SCH9. Moreover, the temperature sensitivity of some RAS2 mutants was increased by disruption of the SCH9 gene. Therefore, SCH9 might be either a downstream element of the RAS adenylyl cyclase pathway, or an element of a parallel pathway. Exploration of the relationship between SCH9 and other elements of the pathway is continuing using by genetic techniques.

CRU WILL CONTRIBUTE TO PARTS 3 AND 4. IN PART 3.1, A REVIEW OF FUTURE GLOBAL MEAN SEA LEVEL (MSL) ESTIMATES WILL BE CONDUCTED. ADDITIONAL ANALYSES WILL BE CARRIED OUT BY DEVELOPING A TRANSIENT-RESPONSE CLIMATE MODEL THAT WILL PRODUCE MSL CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO EXTERNAL FORCINGS SUCH AS CO2. THIS ASPECT OF THE WORK WILL CONCENTRATE ON THE THERMAL RESPONSE OF THE OCEAN AND THE SUBSEQUENT EFFECT ON MSL THROUGH THERMAL EXPANSION. THE MODEL WILL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE THERMAL EFFECTS OF UPWELLING OF COLD WATER FROM THE DEEP OCEAN LAYERS, A FACTOR GENERALLY NEGLECTED IN EXISTING ESTIMATES OF GLOBAL MSL RISE. THIS WORK SHOULD YIELD VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGES AS WELL AS MSL CHANGES.  IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE FUTURE EUROPEAN MSLS, THE VARIOUS CAUSES OF PAST CHANGES IN GLOBAL, REGIONAL AND LOCAL SEA LEVELS WILL BE DIFFERENTIATED USING PAST CLIMATE AND SEA LEVEL DATA AVAILABLE FROM PARTS 1 AND 2 OF THIS PROPOSAL. ONCE THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED, THE REGIONAL AND LOCAL TRENDS CAN BE JUDICIOUSLY EXTRAPOLATED INTO THE FUTURE AND ADDED TO THE GLOBAL MSL PREDICTIONS IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE FUTURE EUROPEAN SEA LEVELS.  THE CRU WILL INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN CLIMATE AND SEA LEVEL ON THE FREQUENCY AND MAGNITUDE OF EXTREME TIDE LEVELS AND STORM SURGES. BASELINE FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS OF STORM SURGE HEIGHTS WITH CURRENT SEA LEVEL WILL BE DERIVED PARTLY THROUGH STATISTICAL ANALYSES OF OBSERVED STORM SURGE DATA, AND PARTLY THROUGH THE USE OF A PHYSICAL STORM SURGE MODEL FOR THE NORTH SEA DEVELOPED BY THE POL. THE POL MODEL WILL BE USED TO SIMULATE THE EXTREME VALUES AND THE METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM WHICH CANNOT BE OBTAINED FROM EMPIRICAL ANALYSES. SCENARIOS OF SEA LEVEL RISE WOULD THEN BE APPLIED AND NEW FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS DERIVED AND COMPARED WITH BASELINE RESULTS IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN THE SENSITIVITY OF THE FREQUENCY OF THE EXTREME EVENTS TO CHANGES IN MSL.  IN PART 4, CRU HAS THREE RELATED OBJECTIVES : 1) TO DEVELOP THE METHODS FOR IDENTIFYING THE ""PRESSURE POINTS"" ALONG THE EUROPEAN COASTLINE WHERE FUTURE SEA LEVEL RISE IS LIKELY TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT; 2) TO DEVELOP THE METHODS FOR IDENTIFYING THE GEOGRAPHIC COMBINATIONS OF SPECIFIC ADVERSE EFFECTS (E.G. SALINIZATION) AND THE PARTICULAR CATEGORIES OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND NATURAL SYSTEMS (E.G. HUMAN POPULATIONS, WETLAND ECOSYSTEMS) THAT ARE LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED; AND 3) TO SELECT SEVERAL CRITICAL LOCATIONS FOR CASE STUDIES."

A study has been undertaken to assess the suitability of tree species for Short Rotation Intensive Culture (SRIC) in Umbria. Robinia pseudoacacia was found to be particularly suited to Mediterranean areas, possessing good productivity in terms of biomass, a close cutting cycle, good physical and chemical qualities, and a favourable environmental impact, large scale availability and no cut restraints. The optimum cutting cycle was 2 to 3 years, with a yield of more than 10 tonnes/year of dry matter (DM). Other interesting species tested were Ginestra (Spartium junceum) and Acacia saligna. All these species belong to the legume family, with nitrogen fixation capacity through the rizobium symbiosis process, thus avoiding the need for nitrogen fertilizing. Another benefit is the low infestation characteristic of intensive cultivations, in that the species themselves are weeds. The use of herbicides for weed control can thus be avoided. Also noteworthy is their high adaptability to many pedoclimatic situations and to poor and even stony soils. To allow an entirely mechanized harvest system a self propelled combine has been designed and is under construction. The machine is suitable for cutting, harvesting, chipping, storage in travel and unloading onto a transport vehicle. Harvest can be carried out throughout the year allowing optimum use of labour and machinery. A passive solar drier has been designed suitable for concentration and drying of the production of an area of 500 to 1000 hectares. The end product is a dry chip (7% moisture) with high heating value (over 3800 kcal/kg). Pre-summer harvest avoids the highest fire hazard period. The coppice plants sprout after 20 to 25 days giving root suckers of 1 m high by the spring. DIFFERENT SPECIES OF SHRUBS AND TREES ARE TRIED, BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT EXPERIENCE IS MADE WITH SPARTIUM JUNCEUM (GINESTRA) AND ROBINIA PSEUDOACACIA (ACACIA). THESE TWO SPECIES HAVE BEEN ALREADY TRIED IN SMALL SCALE ON THE SITE OF THE RESEARCH (CIVITELLA D'ARNO) WITH ENCOURAGING RESULTS. THE 1986 SPRING NEW PLANTATIONS GROW VERY WELL AND IT IS THINKABLE THAT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO HAVE A REGIMEN YIELD OF ABOUT 15 TONS OF DM PER YEAR. THE INTRODUCTION OF THIS TYPE OF CULTIVATION MEANS:   - DECREASED NEEDS OF IMPORTED RAW ENERGY PRODUCTS;  - DECREASED SURPLUS PRODUCTION IN AGRICULTURE;  - REVALUATION OF MARGINAL LANDS;  - CREATION OF NEW JOBS WITH PROFITABLE WORK.   IN ADDITION TO THESE THERE ARE OTHER INDIRECT PUBLIC BENEFITS: FAVOURABLE INFLUENCE ON THE ENVIRONMENT, MORPHOLOGIC PROTECTION OF THE SOIL, REDUCTION OF FLOWING OF RAIN WATERS, PRODUCTION OF NO-POLLUTING COMBUSTIBLES. TO HAVE NO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT PROBLEMS IT IS NECESSARY TO CULTIVATE SPECIES SPONTANEOUS OR ALREADY GROWING IN THE SITE. THE SPECIES MUST HAVE A VERY GOOD RESISTANCE AGAINST THE POLLUTION. ROBINIA PSEUDOACACIA AND SPARTIUM JUNCEUM, ALREADY TESTED IN ""BIOMASSA PERUGIA"" PROJECT, LIVE IN ALL EUROPE AND HAVE THE MENTIONED CHARACTERISTICS."

Research has been carried out in order to obtain new varieties of peas characterized by higher yields and improved yield stability. Emphasis has been laid on quality and quantity of seed proteins in relation to ecotypic variability, drought stress and cold tolerance.  It was concluded that carbon dioxide exchange rate was a useful parameter for selecting drought resistant genotypes. The ideotype for drought is a semileafless plant or a plant with reduced stipules. A fairly good correlation was found between in vitro and in vivo responses for cold tolerance but for developing a screening procedure further research is required. Agronomic trials with randomized blocks - Single seed protein extraction - One and two dimensional gel electrophoresis - Standard techniques for chromosome analysis - In vitro culture.

It also aims, in this context, to pilot a new profession, namely that of skills centre advisers.  Skills Centres are reception and research facilities which use telecommunications and multimedia tools and which are open to all. They function as training and self-training resource centres in each of the towns participating in the network, with methods of providing access to knowledge available to a diverse population.  The system involves reception, career guidance and in some cases the supervision of a personal career project. This reception and career guidance function is assumed by the skills centre adviser. The project therefore involves specific action-training for these individuals. After an analysis of training needs in the three sites involved, training will be offered by the universities and local training centres to assist the acquisition of multi-skilling. This training will lead to the building of a skills reference system and a training reference system able to be exported to other sites.

This new market will revive the traditional industries and create new ones, thus leading to new qualification requirements in the field of alloy development. However, engineers are still trained on the basis of principles derived from iron and steel technology. The aim of the project is to contribute to the competitiveness of the European aluminium industry by updating the principles and rules of design engineering in this sector and by applying these new technologies in university and industrial vocational training programmes. These objectives will also involve greater co-operation between industry, universities and research centres and should promote the creation of joint training programmes and staff mobility projects.  ACTIVITIES The experts in this branch of industry will explore, within the context of a transnational system, the possibilities of using aluminium to better effect in the development of alloys. They will identify and draw up new rules for the development of alloys adapted for aluminium, will pinpoint new qualification requirements and study the new directives. New training programmes and tools will then be created and implemented using open and distance teaching methodology in training institutions and in industry.  PRODUCTS - Production of training programmes, methodologies and tools for the development of aluminium alloys, designed for initial training institutions and in-company training. - Creation and reinforcement of networks of branch specialists from universities and companies.

Biotechnology is a very high skill-based industry, and it is anticipated that there will be enormous gaps in terms of knowledge and skills in the existing workforce of traditional industries. This project aims to develop more accessible training methods and develop new qualifications to enable workers to acquire new high-level skills and adapt to technological change. The partners will transfer results from areas which are rich in expertise to those regions where the training is poor. They will also stimulate the dissemination of biotechnology into other sectors.  ACTIVITIES The partners will gather information on the level of knowledge in traditional industries pertaining to biotechnology, the level of skills within various occupational sectors and the level of knowledge of the external factors which are generating change in the industries. They will develop and deliver workshops to increase awareness of the potential of biotechnology and the human resource implications. Future skills training and qualification needs to enable companies to achieve their business targets will be defined. Finally, a guide on the trends and challenges facing specific industrial sectors vis à vis biotechnology and the human resource implications will be produced.  PRODUCTS - Training courses for traditional industries on the potential application of biotechnology and human resource implications.  - A guide for traditional industries on the trends and challenges of biotechnology and the training implications.

100|grant.3740874|AC367; 46597; GESTALT|Getting education systems talking across leading-edge technologies|Getting education systems talking across leading-edge technologies|Main Objective   GESTALT will bring an online training demonstrator using the results of three ACTS projects:    -AC052 (PROSPECT) - Providing Multi-domain management in the expected open service market;    -AC100 (RENAISSANCE) - Integrating high performance services for interactive vocational training for European regeneration;    -AC221 (GAIA) - Providing generic architecture for information availability.   Technical Approach   The novel element of the project is the way in which the components from the above listed projects are integrated. The proposed strategy exploits two mechanisms for enabling the integration:    -The specification of open Business Objects comprising the interfaces between the various software system components within the GESTALT Architecture. These object specifications will consist of IDL descriptions and will be implemented within the GESTALT demonstrator;    -The definition of a metadata format capable of representing the multimedia courseware resources and their requirements for correct operation. The metadata will be developed in compliance with the defined format which will be deployed in the GESTALT demonstrator.   Summary of Trial   User-based trials will be conducted at the University of Naples and will include a broker service providing information on courses, modules and resources available, as well as online access to these via a web-enabled Learning Environment.  Network Performance trials will be conducted on the University of Sheffield Testbed which consists of configurable ATM, Cable Modem, ISDN and LAN Technologies. Expected Achievements   The resulting GESTALT demonstrator will encompass:    -Creating Discovery Services capable of offering users the ability to search, locate and access online interactive multimedia vocational training courseware (e.g. short-course or individual module selection) from the training institution of their choice. It will exploit also the broker kernel model developed by GAIA;    -Extending Metadata to cover interoperability across heterogeneous platforms, Quality of Service requirements of individual resources over network links (exploiting service management issues from PROSPECT), minimum client configuration requirements and appropriate rendering tool information;    -Providing Online Training through the delivery of courseware materials previously developed in RENAISSANCE and PROSPECT. The demonstrator will include a number of elements from the GESTALT Architecture. These will include a web-based client interface and web server technology integrated with the LE database. The LE will manage the learning process and monitor trainee progress (from RENAISSANCE) and integrate with the institutional back-of-house MIS system for administration.   Expected Impact   It is the intention of the project to publicise both the object descriptions and the metadata syntax and, wherever possible, to align these with related standardisation developments both within Europe and globally, thus maximising the possibility of their widespread adoption.   Main contributions to the programme objectives: Main deliverables The project has defined a flexible component based architecture for brokerage and delivery of online learning and built a pilot implementation for validation purposes. Contribution to the programme The project has demonstrated the integration of CORBA and LDAP distributed platform technology with XML-based data modelling and state-of-the-art QoS management to create a scalable online learning architecture. Key Issues   GESTALT will address the issues of integrating a number of technologies able to support the planned integration. CORBA and DCOM will be used to provide the distributed platform support required by this application. A metadata format servicing the requirements of the application will be specified, drawing on the work of bodies such as the US IMS Project and the IEEE LTSC. In addition, W3C XML metadata extensions, such as SMIL, will be explored for providing object synchronisation.
